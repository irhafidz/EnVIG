abstract = {Visualization is invaluable for communicating complex data, and it is becoming more important when researchers seek insights, or when they need to share their insights with end-users with diverse level of expertise such as policy-makers or the general public. In this paper, we detail how we approach this issue using the HAVEN and ProjecTable systems we developed. These systems share data of projected renewable energy supply based on several possible scenarios that should help Hawaii achieve 100% renewable energy by 2045. However, each system offers different features directed at end-users interested in different levels of detail. We describe here the two systems and their use, both separately and in conjunction.},

abstract = {Electricity has become a vital part of the modern life. Ever increasing electricity demand and inefficiency of the old electricity grid have led to the new vision which is called smart grid. Since, much work has been done to study the different aspects of the smart grid using computer and mathematical models. However little is done to combine those efforts to study the smart grid and ecodistrict in the same context. In this work we discuss the importance of the smart grid technologies in an ecodistrict development and the theoretical approaches for modeling smart grid and ecodistrict. Further more, we propose an agent-based model of ecodistricts with smart grid elements, by following a modeling approach called ASPECS. Though the simulations based on this kind of models can not be used as an exact predictive tools, it provides us with an exploratory tool to study how to integrate smart grid elements in an ecodistrict, and how different actors interact with each other.},

abstract = {Interventions aiming to shift household energy consumption patterns commonly involve the provision of energy feedback. This feedback typically constitutes detailed numerical data regarding energy generation, consumption and price, and is communicated via energy monitors, apps, and other smart devices. Yet for a number of reasons both the concept of energy feedback and its implementation are rather problematic. Most significantly, interventions commonly depend on the ability of laypeople to interpret often complex and unfamiliar numerical information, as well as use, and regularly engage with, the various devices which communicate the feedback data. Moreover, by emphasising the perceived importance of data expressed in units like kilowatts and kilowatt hours, conventional feedback interventions inadvertently serve to displace the intuitive ways in which householders already engage with, and understand, energy. While the impetus to communicate energy feedback remains, there is nonetheless an evident need to do so in a more accessible manner. Drawing on preliminary findings from an ethnographic research project, this paper considers the opportunities for smart lights to visually communicate energy feedback in an intelligible and meaningful way that builds on, rather than overlooks, laypeople's existing capacities.},

This has motivated researchers to explore techniques for efficient, systematic management of energy. In this work we propose a fractal IoT architecture for smart community to addressed the challenges such as variation of energy availability, accessibility and demand. The architecture is deployed and tested in several scenarios such as Smart Building Smart Grid and Microgrid. A solar Microgrid setup is installed in a tribal village in Kerala, India consisting of 42 homes. This paper explains how the different features are integrated to develop smart buildings, and self-sustainable autonomous neighborhood's using these multiple case studies. The experimental result shows that the system is able to achieve the IoT features such as adaptability, interoperability and scalability by providing consistent performance in the hostel buildings with 800 occupants as well as homes totaling of 126 occupants in the tribal village.},

abstract = {There is growing interest in city and community scale energy efficiency goals across the US and around the world [1]. Forward thinking developers are expressing interest in developing methods to track the actual operations of new urban developments and campuses. Local governments and developers are exploring how to ensure that the built infrastructure, including buildings, transportation, energy generation and storage assets, is not only designed for energy efficiency, but operates efficiently as well. There is a need for city and district scale tools to support energy analysis from design through operations. Smart city data analytics is a growing area of interest in the smart city technology space. However, while there is enthusiasm for the concept of smart city energy analytics, there is a lack of common semantic data models, interoperable systems, and methods to collect data and support decision-making for operating multi-building city- and district-scale energy systems. Urban developers are asking broad questions about how such a system might be designed, built, valued, maintained, and optimized. This paper describes ongoing research to explore and define a City or District Energy Operations System (CityEOS).},

abstract = {Over the past decade, the idea of smart homes has been conceived as a potential solution to counter energy crises or to at least mitigate its intensive destructive consequences in the residential building sector. Smart homes have emerged as one of the applications of Internet of Things (IoT) that enabled the use of technology to automate and customize home services with reference to users' preferences. However, the concept of smart homes is still not fully matured due to the weak handling of diverse datasets that can be exploited to promote more adaptive, personalised, and context aware capabilities. Furthermore, instead of just deploying integrated automated services in the homes, the focus should be to bring the concerns of potential stakeholders into consideration. In this paper, we have exploited the concepts of ontologies to capture all sorts of data (classes and their subclasses) that belong to one domain based on stakeholders' requirements analysis. We have also explored their significant associations with other datasets from another domain. In addition, this research work provides an insight about what sorts of interdependencies exist between different datasets across different ontological models such as Smart homes ontology model and ICT ontology model.},

This perfectly fits our vision of developing an interactive web-based urban energy dashboard, which shows not only static data but also real-time dynamic data such as measured data from sensors, all integrated into 3D city models. Evolution of the mentioned dashboard is presented using three different case study regions based on data availability and its urban scale: 1) Landkreis Ludwigsburg - A district in Baden W\"{u}rttemberg, Germany showing static urban energy data of specific heating demand 2) Brooklyn - A borough in New York City showing urban energy data of specific heating demand (incl. domestic hot water) over a temporal resolution of 5 years and 3) W\"{u}stenrot - A small municipality in Germany showing real-time dynamic energy data streaming from sensors integrated into a 3D city model. Such an interactive dashboard presents both static and dynamic urban energy data to the citizens and city administration in the most straightforward yet effective manner.},

Big Data technologies play a significant role within IoT processes, as visual analytics tools, generating valuable knowledge in real-time in order to support critical decision making. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of visualization methods, tools, and techniques for the IoT. We position data visualization inside the visual analytics process by reviewing the visual analytics pipeline. We provide a study of various chart types available for data visualization and analyze rules for employing each one of them, taking into account the special conditions of the particular use case. We further examine some of the most promising visualization tools. Since each IoT domain is isolated in terms of Big Data approaches, we investigate visualization issues in each domain. Additionally, we review visualization methods oriented to anomaly detection. Finally, we provide an overview of the major challenges in IoT visualizations.},

abstract = {A world consisting of billions of service-oriented client devices and thousands of data centers can deliver a diverse range of services, from social networking to management of our natural resources. However, these services must scale in order to meet the fundamental needs of society. To enable such scaling, the total cost of ownership of the data centers that host the services and comprise the vast majority of service delivery costs will need to be reduced. As energy drives the total cost of ownership of data centers, there is a need for a new paradigm in design and management of data centers that minimizes energy used across their lifetimes, from “cradle to cradle”. This tutorial article presents a blueprint for a “net-zero data center”: one that offsets any electricity used from the grid via adequate on-site power generation that gets fed back to the grid at a later time. We discuss how such a data center addresses the total cost of ownership, illustrating that contrary to the oft-held view of sustainability as “paying more to be green”, sustainable data centers—built on a framework that focuses on integrating supply and demand management from end-to-end—can concurrently lead to lowest cost and lowest environmental impact.},

We describe three use cases of the system: using Wattom to power connected appliances and understand the environmental impact of their use in real time; scheduling these power events; and presenting users with personal consumption data desegregated by device. We conclude with a user study in which the effectiveness of the plug's novel interactive capabilities is assessed (mid-air, hand-based motion matching). The study explores the effectiveness of Wattom and motion matching input in a realistic setup, where the user is not always directly ahead of the interface, and not always willing to point straight at the device (e.g., when the plug is at an uncomfortable angle). Despite not using a graphical display, our results demonstrate that our motion matching implementation was effective in line with previous work, and that participants' pointing angle did not significantly affect their performance. On the other hand, participants were more effective while pointing straight at Wattom, but reported not to finding this significantly more strenuating then when pointing to a comfortable position of their choice.},

Energy management systems try to contribute to addressing this challenge by enabling an intelligent use and combination of different energy sources by capturing and visualizing energy usage and production data to enable energy efficiency improvement measures. In this paper, we present Selena, a prototypical energy management system that is implemented using the serverless computing paradigm. Essential design goals for Selena are both extensibility, so that many different data sources and providers (e.g., measurement systems) can be integrated easily, as well as efficient scalability, so that the system can be used from small (e.g., one building) to large installations (potentially entire neighborhoods) with deployment cost commensurate with the installation size. Our initial experiences with Selena indicate that the serverless paradigm is very well suited to capture and process energy-related data reliably and has excellent scaling properties due to the elastic compute platform that it is built upon.},

Such perception of audiences sees a radical shift in contemporary participatory art which fosters a greater creative involvement and appropriation of audiences. In this paper, we augment the music listening experience through sound-reactive visuals which vary according to listeners' arousal response. Our approach seeks to involve audiences in the live generation of visuals accompanying music, giving participants an indirect, yet creative, role. We present an implementation of our concept, Mood Visualiser, a web application which receives data from a wireless bio-sensing platform used to characterise the arousal response of listeners at the physiological level. Mood Visualiser provides an artistic visual representation of the music and the listening experience derived from both the audio and physiological domains. We describe and evaluate a use case that focuses on a listener's electro-dermal activity (EDA), a correlate of arousal (or excitement). Feedback received in user surveys was overall positive and we identified further design challenges around the visual expression of emotions perceived in music, and the suitability of sensor interfaces during the music listening activity.},

The application is intended to be used as a solid data basis for political discussions, nudging, and story telling about the German energy transition to renewables, called "Energiewende". It was therefore designed to be intuitive, easy to use, and provide information for a broad spectrum of users that do not need any domain-specific knowledge. Users are able to select different categories of power plants and look up their positions on an overview map. Glyphs indicate their exact positions and a selection mechanism allows users to compare the power output on different time scales using stacked area charts or ThemeRivers. As an evaluation of the application, we have collected web access statistics and conducted an online survey with respect to the intuitiveness, usability, and informativeness.},

With the widespread of IoT, a myriad of sensors are producing a large quantity of numeric data. Still, as users, we are inclined to consume data that has been processed and displayed as visual information in order to facilitate decision processes.Web standards have evolved significantly over the past decade with X3D being adopted as an open ISO standard for Web3D. X3D and associated extensions like WebGL allows web-enabled visualization and facilitates remote collaboration.In this paper, we present a software architecture that allows data collection from IoT sensors, data processing and an interactive Web-enabled 3D visualization using the X3D standard for soft real-time systems. We also discuss the potential applications of such a system in several domains.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the concept of Smart City provides a rich analytical context, highlighting the need to store and process vast amounts of heterogeneous data flowing at different velocities. This data is defined as Big Data, which imposes significant difficulties in traditional data techniques and technologies. Data Warehouses (DWs) have long been recognized as a fundamental enterprise asset, providing fact-based decision support for several organizations. The concept of DW is evolving. Traditionally, Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs) are used to store historical data, providing different analytical perspectives regarding several business processes. With the current advancements in Big Data techniques and technologies, the concept of Big Data Warehouse (BDW) emerges to surpass several limitations of traditional DWs. This paper presents a novel approach for designing and implementing BDWs, which has been supporting the SusCity data visualization platform. The BDW is a crucial component of the SusCity research project in the context of Smart Cities, supporting analytical tasks based on data collected in the city of Lisbon.},

We examine the current roles of information security visualisations and place these roles in the wider information visualisation discourse. We present an analytic lens which divides visualisations into three categories: journalistic, scientific and critical visualisations. We then present a case study that uses these three categories of visualisations to further support information security practice.Two significant results emerge from this case study: (1) visualisations that promote critical thinking and reflection (a form of critical visualisation) support the multi-stakeholder nature of risk assessment and (2) a preparatory stage in risk assessment is sometimes needed by service designers in order to establish the service design before conducting a formal risk assessment.The reader is invited to explore the images in the digital version of this paper where they can zoom in to particular aspects of the images and view the images in colour.},

abstract = {Recent global smart city efforts resemble the establishment of electricity networks when electricity was first invented, which meant the start of a new era to sell electricity as a utility. A century later, in the smart era, the network to deliver services goes far beyond a single entity like electricity. Supplemented by a well-established Internet infrastructure that can run an endless number of applications, abundant processing and storage capabilities of clouds, resilient edge computing, and sophisticated data analysis like machine learning and deep learning, an already-booming Internet of Things movement makes this new era far more exciting.In this article, we present a multi-faceted survey of machine intelligence in modern implementations. We partition smart city infrastructure into application, sensing, communication, security, and data planes and put an emphasis on the data plane as the mainstay of computing and data storage. We investigate (i) a centralized and distributed implementation of data plane’s physical infrastructure and (ii) a complementary application of data analytics, machine learning, deep learning, and data visualization to implement robust machine intelligence in a smart city software core. We finalize our article with pointers to open issues and challenges.},

However, it is still unclear how live data transmitted by connected devices informs the design of these products, going beyond performance optimisation to support creative practices. Design can be enriched by data captured by connected devices, from usage logs to environmental sensors, and data about the devices and people around them. Through a series of workshops, this paper contributes industry and academia perspectives on the future of data-driven product design. We highlight HCI challenges, issues and implications, including sensemaking and the generation of design insight. We further challenge current notions of data-driven design and envision ways in which future HCI research can develop ways to work with data in the design process in a connected, rich, human manner.},

Such devices can be deployed in a laboratory or “in the wild” in natural environments. The latter allows one to collect behavioral data that is not contaminated by the artificiality of a laboratory experiment. Using IoT devices in ordinary environments also brings the benefits of reduced cost, as compared with lab experiments, and less disturbance to the participants’ daily routines, which in turn helps with recruiting them into the research. However, in this case, it is essential to have an IoT infrastructure that can be easily and swiftly installed and from which real-time data can be securely and straightforwardly collected. In this article, we present MakeSense, an IoT testbed that enables real-world experimentation for large-scale social research on indoor activities through real-time monitoring and/or situation-aware applications. The testbed features quick setup, flexibility in deployment, the integration of a range of IoT devices, resilience, and scalability. We also present two case studies to demonstrate the use of the testbed: one in homes and one in offices.},

abstract = {Urbanization's rapid progress has modernized many people's lives but also engendered big issues, such as traffic congestion, energy consumption, and pollution. Urban computing aims to tackle these issues by using the data that has been generated in cities (e.g., traffic flow, human mobility, and geographical data). Urban computing connects urban sensing, data management, data analytics, and service providing into a recurrent process for an unobtrusive and continuous improvement of people's lives, city operation systems, and the environment. Urban computing is an interdisciplinary field where computer sciences meet conventional city-related fields, like transportation, civil engineering, environment, economy, ecology, and sociology in the context of urban spaces. This article first introduces the concept of urban computing, discussing its general framework and key challenges from the perspective of computer sciences. Second, we classify the applications of urban computing into seven categories, consisting of urban planning, transportation, the environment, energy, social, economy, and public safety and security, presenting representative scenarios in each category. Third, we summarize the typical technologies that are needed in urban computing into four folds, which are about urban sensing, urban data management, knowledge fusion across heterogeneous data, and urban data visualization. Finally, we give an outlook on the future of urban computing, suggesting a few research topics that are somehow missing in the community.},

abstract = { Mental disorders can have a significant, negative impact on sufferers' lives, as well as on their friends and family, healthcare systems and other parts of society. Approximately 25 % of all people in Europe and the USA experience a mental disorder at least once in their lifetime. Currently, monitoring mental disorders relies on subjective clinical self-reporting rating scales, which were developed more than 50 years ago. In this paper, we discuss how mobile phones can support the treatment of mental disorders by (1) implementing human---computer interfaces to support therapy and (2) collecting relevant data from patients' daily lives to monitor the current state and development of their mental disorders. Concerning the first point, we review various systems that utilize mobile phones for the treatment of mental disorders. We also evaluate how their core design features and dimensions can be applied in other, similar systems. Concerning the second point, we highlight the feasibility of using mobile phones to collect comprehensive data including voice data, motion and location information. Data mining methods are also reviewed and discussed. Based on the presented studies, we summarize advantages and drawbacks of the most promising mobile phone technologies for detecting mood disorders like depression or bipolar disorder. Finally, we discuss practical implementation details, legal issues and business models for the introduction of mobile phones as medical devices.},

abstract = {Water is essential for human survival. Although approximately 71% of the world is covered in water, only 2.5% of this is fresh water; hence, fresh water is a valuable resource that must be carefully monitored and maintained. In developing countries, 80% of people are without access to potable water. Cholera is still reported in more than 50 countries. In Africa, 75% of the drinking water comes from underground sources, which makes water monitoring an issue of key concern, as water monitoring can be used to track water quality changes over time, identify existing or emerging problems, and design effective intervention programs to remedy water pollution. It is important to have detailed knowledge of potable water quality to enable proper treatment and also prevent contamination. In this article, we review methods for water quality monitoring (WQM) from traditional manual methods to more technologically advanced methods employing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for in situ WQM. In particular, we highlight recent developments in the sensor devices, data acquisition procedures, communication and network architectures, and power management schemes to maintain a long-lived operational WQM system. Finally, we discuss open issues that need to be addressed to further advance automatic WQM using WSNs.},

abstract = {In aesthetic inquiry, the sublime has remained a versatile signifier used to theorize art movements across the ages in a wide variety of artistic media. Highly influential in literature and visual arts, it has adapted to the sensibilities of changing times and objects of study. A new understanding of the concept has emerged today: the data sublime. From data visualizations to mass surveillance, the moniker data sublime has been used in the past decade to refer to the abstract manifestations of information technology in the everyday. This expression of sublimity foregrounds data as a form that is virtual, transcendent and beyond the reach of the sense apparatus. Yet data as an artifact is indelibly written and recorded by human hands. What urban representations might this paradox render possible? Are dataspaces myths or the experience of real places? This essay speculates on some of the relationships that might exist between data sublimity and placemaking in design research. It contributes to the literature by engaging in a reflection on how the data sublime could be recast and applied to media architecture. Several case studies are presented to ground this discussion and suggest potential avenues for future research.},

Some techniques have been developed that handle the volume of these datasets by aggregating their information based on the data structure or model. Other approaches exploit specific characteristics of the datasets, such as semantic annotations, to present the information to the users in semantically defined ways. In an era that the volume and diversity of the available information increases exponentially and more users are interested in exploring it, it is crucial to provide a technique that will allow the exploitation of diverse and very large linked datasets in a scalable way independent of any characteristics of the input dataset. We present here a generic divide and conquer technique that can offer the required scalability to exploit any input dataset regardless its size and characteristics. The proposed technique has been tested in the context of interactive representation of very large linked datasets as graphs.},

abstract = {The vast amount of data generated from diverse sources provides both an opportunity and a challenge to urban policymakers and decision-makers. The application of data science and analytics to parse the detailed data that city agencies continually collect offers the opportunity to identify new areas for operational efficiencies, enhanced service delivery, and better informed policy design and implementation. This exploratory paper articulates the theoretical, practical, and pedagogical foundations for the fields of urban informatics and civic analytics and the challenges and tensions to effectively applying computational approaches to urban management, policy, and planning. It describes the state of the field, defines the need for computational methods in cities, and presents the tensions in creating data-driven approaches that both acknowledge and capitalize on shifting modes of learning, working, and decision-making. The paper concludes with a discussion of connecting urban theory to informatics practice.1},

abstract = {Immersive virtual experiences are becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives. Besides visual and auditory feedback, other senses like haptics, smell and taste can enhance immersion in virtual environments. Most solutions presented in the past require specialized hardware to provide appropriate feedback. To mitigate this need, researchers conceptualized approaches leveraging everyday physical objects as proxies instead. Transferring these approaches to varying physical environments and conditions, however, poses significant challenges to a variety of disciplines such as HCI, VR, haptics, tracking, perceptual science, design, etc. This workshop will explore the integration of everyday items for multi-sensory feedback in virtual experiences and sets course for respective future research endeavors. Since the community still seems to lack a cohesive agenda for advancing this domain, the goal of this workshop is to bring together individuals interested in everyday proxy objects to review past work, build a unifying research agenda, share ongoing work, and encourage collaboration.},

abstract = {Engaging consumers with energy use is a challenging endeavor; however, different forms of data visualization may help by creating relationships between a user and their data. Here we propose and conduct an experiment to test two different visualizations: an "engineering-type" visualization of a bar chart, and an "ambient-type" visualization of a cartoon tree. Participants in a competitive energy-saving game within an office building in Singapore received weekly emails visualizing their energy consumption and encouraging them to interact with their online game profile, and energy use was measured in addition to qualitative feedback through pre-experiment and post-experiment surveys. We find that the engineering-type visual did not result in statistically significant reductions whereas the ambient-type did, resulting in an average decrease of 82 Wh per day for the three days following treatment. Additionally, we find that greater engagement uniformly correlates positively with energy savings. A finite state machine simulation indicates that were this experiment scaled to 1000 people over 100 days, the total energy savings might be expected to be 1.1MWh.},

Based on our nine-month long ethnography at eight residential areas in Dhaka, Bangladesh, this paper reports how online fame drives local users to produce digital images of their houses mimicking various Western standards, which in turn, brings changes to the organization, aesthetics, and functions of domestic spaces. This paper also describes how such digital image mediated transformations to local architecture are diminishing traditional spaces, altering their usual functions, and limiting the movement of many women inside their home. Drawing from a rich body of literature in postcolonialism, critical image theory, architecture, and Islamic feminism, we explain how these practices demonstrate a subaltern experience of using social media in the Global South. We further discuss design implications to both HCI and architecture to address these issues, and connect our findings to the broader agendas of HCI around social justice and global development.},

Designing technology-led interventions to encourage pro-environmental behaviour that acknowledge and support this complexity is a significant challenge. This paper discusses the design and evaluation of an EUED intervention implemented in the corporate infrastructure of a UK university administration department. Two intervention types, group feedback and group goal-setting were implemented. 16 participants were recruited and engaged with a four stage study (baseline, group feedback, group goal setting, and baseline) for a duration of 4 months. This study design allowed us to track clearly any changes in mid-term energy usage behaviour during and beyond intervention. Findings suggest that, surprisingly, participant energy consumption increased during the intervention period compared to baseline conditions. These results demonstrate that simple group-based behaviour change methods can be counter-productive in the workplace, illustrating the complex and unpredictable nature of intervention in this design space.},

This paper proposes a semantic gateway for IoT, a middleware capable to forward data streams to and from devices by means of different protocols such as MQTT, Socket and even non-IP device specific protocols. Also, the proposed middleware, which includes a REST/JSON programming interface for other middleware and for IoT applications, is considered to be semantic because it has the ability to receive data from sensors that communicate using different protocol suites, such as the TCP/IP stack and wireless sensor network protocols, and then performs data transformations, semantic intermediation and routing to the cloud. The proposed gateway is designed as a component to allow the application of fog computation principles in IoT networks. Based on tests performed with a developed prototype, this paper presents evaluation results regarding the functionality and the performance of the proposed gateway.},

Results showed that our system detects falls, using computational intelligence techniques, with 96.2% accuracy and 81% sensitivity and 97.8% specificity. We extracted and estimated gait parameters, and compared it to the GAITRite system (the gold standard), so that the system reliably estimates the walking speed, stride length and stored time with percentage errors of 1.43%, -4.32%, and -5.73% respectively. Recent results show that the system can count number of people with high accuracy. We developed a database system and web applications for immediate alerts on adverse events, and retain these data in the cloud for years, if necessary, to provide further data analysis.},

abstract = {In order to reduce the possibility of neural injury from seizures and sidestep the need for a neurologist to spend hours on manually reviewing the EEG recording, it is critical to automatically detect and classify "interictal-ictal continuum" (IIC) patterns from EEG data. However, the existing IIC classification techniques are shown to be not accurate and robust enough for clinical use because of the lack of high quality labels of EEG segments as training data. Obtaining high-quality labeled data is traditionally a manual process by trained clinicians that can be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone. In this work, we propose Smile, an industrial scale system that provides an end-to-end solution to the IIC pattern classification problem. The core components of Smile include a visualization-based time series labeling module and a deep-learning based active learning module. The labeling module enables the users to explore and label 350 million EEG segments (30TB) at interactive speed. The multiple coordinated views allow the users to examine the EEG signals from both time domain and frequency domain simultaneously. The active learning module first trains a deep neural network that automatically extracts both the local features with respect to each segment itself and the long term dynamics of the EEG signals to classify IIC patterns. Then leveraging the output of the deep learning model, the EEG segments that can best improve the model are selected and prompted to clinicians to label. This process is iterated until the clinicians and the models show high degree of agreement. Our initial experimental results show that our Smile system allows the clinicians to label the EEG segments at will with a response time below 500 ms. The accuracy of the model is progressively improved as more and more high quality labels are acquired over time.},

abstract = {The recent profusion of sensors has given consumers and researchers the ability to collect significant amounts of data. However, understanding sensor data can be a challenge, because it is voluminous, multi-sourced, and unintelligible. Nonetheless, intelligent systems, such as activity recognition, require pattern analysis of sensor data streams to produce compelling results; machine learning (ML) applications enable this type of analysis. However, the number of ML experts able to proficiently classify sensor data is limited, and there remains a lack of interactive, usable tools to help intermediate users perform this type of analysis. To learn which features these tools must support, we conducted interviews with intermediate users of ML and conducted two probe-based studies with a prototype ML and visual analytics system, Gimlets. Our system implements ML applications for sensor-based time-series data as a novel domain-specific prototype that integrates interactive visual analytic features into the ML pipeline. We identify future directions for usable ML systems based on sensor data that will enable intermediate users to build systems that have been prohibitively difficult.},

The server-side "push" paradigm is particularly useful for creating novel tools such as CORNET3D, where real-time 3D visualization is required. CORNET3D is an innovative Web3D interface to a research and education test bed for Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA). Our system can drive several 2D and 3D portrayals of spectral data and radio performance metrics from a live, online system. The testbed can further integrate the data portrayals into a multi-user "serious game" to teach students about strategies for the optimal use of spectrum resources by providing them with real-time scoring based on their choices of radio transmission parameters. This paper describes the web service architecture and Webd3D front end for our DSA testbed, detailing new methods for spectrum visualization and the applications they enable.},

Here, the development and evaluation of a wireless wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor to detect epileptic seizures from changes in the cardiac rhythm is described. The ECG is measured using an ultra-low-power circuit for bio-potential acquisition. The ECG data is continuously analyzed by embedded algorithms: a robust beat-detection algorithm combined with a real-time heart beat-based epileptic seizure detector. Each detected seizure candidate triggers its transmission to a receiving radio-station. At the same time, the detected events and the raw ECG data are stored on an embedded memory card from which they can be wirelessly downloaded for off-line analysis. The performance of the system in terms of power-consumption, robustness of the radio-link and comfort of use is reported. In its current implementation, the proposed ECG-monitor prototype has a size of 52x36x15mm3, and an autonomy of one day. Wireless, miniaturized and comfortable, this prototype opens new perspectives for continuous and ambulatory health monitoring.},

The structure of the piece is derived from metrics on energy accumulation over a period of 2.2 nanoseconds resulting from the targeting of 60 laser beams on a single tetrahedral hohlraum in weapons testing experiments as carried out by the Los Alamos Inertial Confinement Fusion unit, at the Omega Laser Facility at the University of Rochester. Pulse Shape 22 is an exploration of architectural space through the use of site- and time-specific information found in regions of the electromagnetic spectrum outside the reaches of the human sensory apparatus. It is an attempt to alter the audience's perceptions of their surroundings and create a moment of rupture from hidden worlds found in our local environment.},

While modern information technologies provide the necessary underpinnings expressed by the terms “digital” or the outdated “electronic,” for this public-sector phenomenon, technology in and by itself is not sufficient to capture the scope and various dimensions of Digital Government, which, unobserved at first, and later even disputed, continue to have increasingly transformational influences on the business of government in all its aspects, on all levels, and in all branches. In this disquisition, the evolution of Digital Government is portrayed and discussed from its humble beginnings to the intermediary present along with a projection and a preview of where this fascinating multidisciplinary domain of research and practice might lead in the next two decades. It is claimed that the transformation of the business of government is just beginning, and it is argued that major and undeniable instances of transition can be observed in the next decade.},

A robust prediction system is proposed to cope with various temporal foot traffic patterns. The empirical evaluation of our experiment shows that the proposed ARIMA model is effective in modelling both weekdays and weekend patterns, outperforming other state-of-art models for short-term prediction of pedestrian counts. The model is capable of accurately predicting pedestrian numbers up to 16 days in advance, on multiple look-ahead times.

abstract = {The Internet of Things equips citizens with a phenomenal new means for online participation in sharing economies. When agents self-determine options from which they choose, for instance, their resource consumption and production, while these choices have a collective systemwide impact, optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known as NP-hard. In such challenging computational problems, centrally managed (deep) learning systems often require personal data with implications on privacy and citizens’ autonomy. This article envisions an alternative unsupervised and decentralized collective learning approach that preserves privacy, autonomy, and participation of multi-agent systems self-organized into a hierarchical tree structure. Remote interactions orchestrate a highly efficient process for decentralized collective learning. This disruptive concept is realized by I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections, accompanied by a paradigmatic software artifact. Strikingly, I-EPOS outperforms related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange full information. This article contributes new experimental findings about the influence of network topology and planning on learning efficiency as well as findings on techno-socio-economic tradeoffs and global optimality. Experimental evaluation with real-world data from energy and bike sharing pilots demonstrates the grand potential of collective learning to design ethically and socially responsible participatory sharing economies.},

abstract = {Acoustic sensors offer a promising new tool to detect furtive animals; however, sifting through years of audio data is fraught with challenges. Developing automatic detection software still requires a large dataset of calls that have been accurately annotated by experts. Few studies have explored how people identify species by vocalisations in the wild, and how this skill can be applied to designing technologies for locating and identifying calls in recordings. To explore how birders often find and identify animals by calls and share their observations, we conducted qualitative interviews and a visualization-review activity with nine birders, eliciting insight into their existing practices, knowledge, and visualisation interpretation. We found that visualisations evoked memories demonstrating birder expertise on the natural history, behaviours, and habitats of birds. Birders were curious and learned from exploring the abstract patterns in visualisations of acoustic data, relying on past experiences with nature to interpret acoustic visualisations. Birders often wanted to corroborate findings with other birders by reviewing acoustic recordings and local bird lists. This study demonstrates how qualitative review of visualisations can elicit a nuanced understanding of community practices, knowledge, and sensemaking, which are essential to improve design of future technologies.},

However, studies addressing the industrial context are quite rare, and due to the diversity of machines, processes, tasks, personal motivations, teams and the specific organizational culture of companies, it is not sufficient to provide only consumption data. For an adequate consideration of these factors, detailed design guidelines and system concepts are currently missing. However, this study shows the potential that a common understanding of consumption data can emerge through suitable visualization to support everyday work and possibilities of data sharing. Therefore, we show exemplarily how a design can be derived from empirically collected requirements and how a system concept can look like that enrich current eco-feedback design research for the industrial context.},

The movements are designed to allow a sense of immersion that would be difficult to achieve with an alternative interface.A vibrotactile based haptic feedback is incorporated in the device to further enhance the connection between the user and the game environment by providing immediate confirmation of game events. When used for navigating an aircraft simulator, this device invites playful action and thrill. It bridges new territory on portable, low cost solutions for haptic devices in gaming contexts.},

The increasing proliferation of big data and the great advances made in data science do not herald in an era where all problems can be solved by deep learning and artificial intelligence.

abstract = {We present TableHop, a tabletop display that provides controlled self-actuated deformation and vibro-tactile feedback to an elastic fabric surface while retaining the ability for high-resolution visual projection. The surface is made of a highly stretchable pure spandex fabric that is electrostatically actuated using electrodes mounted on its top or underside. It uses transparent indium tin oxide electrodes and high-voltage modulation to create controlled surface deformations. Our setup actuates pixels and creates deformations in the fabric up to +/- 5 mm. Since the electrodes are transparent, the fabric surface functions as a diffuser for rear-projected visual images, and avoid occlusion by users or actuators. Users can touch and interact with the fabric to experience expressive interactions as with any fabric based shape-changing interface. By using frequency modulation in the high-voltage circuit, it can also create localized tactile sensations on the user's fingertip when touching the surface. We provide simulation and experimental results for the shape of the deformation and frequency of the vibration of the surface. These results can be used to build prototypes of different sizes and form-factors. We present a working prototype of TableHop that has 30x40 cm2 surface area and uses a grid of 3x3 transparent electrodes. It uses a maximum of 9.46 mW and can create tactile vibrations of up to 20 Hz. TableHop can be scaled to make large interactive surfaces and integrated with other objects and devices. TableHop will improve user interaction experience on 2.5D deformable displays.},

In particular, university dormitory setting provides an excellent venue to explore effectiveness of energy feedback mechanisms. Most of such dormitory studies used a web-based portal for enabling competition among students as motivation for energy saving. Moreover, the majority of them have been conducted in the developed world. In this paper, we report a 6-week study conducted in an Indian university with 432 students (18 groups), comparing five different eco-feedback techniques. The results show that Daily Individual Paper Feedback encourages more conservation, both among males and females, with 19.4% and 7.6% reduction, respectively. We conclude with a discussion on the importance of easy and regular availability of information, effectiveness of paper-based feedback, and role of gender in eco-feedback.},

abstract = {We present a method of selective wireless power transferring for paper computing. The novelty of this method lies in the power transmitter can be controlled to selectively activate different receivers in the context of wireless power transferring with multiple receivers. This was achieved by changing the output frequency of the power transmitter and the impedance of the receivers. With this method, users could easily design new types of paper-computing system without worrying about the arrangement of the massive wire connection to power supply. This technology combining with paper computing can become a physical rendering system using paper-craft, such as paper folding and cutting. In this paper we describe the implementation of our method, the advantages and limitations, the applications and the future directions.},

abstract = {This paper begins to describe a new kind of database, one that explores a diverse range of movement in the field of dance through capture of different bodies and different backgrounds - or what we are terming movement vernaculars. We re-purpose Ivan Illich's concept of 'vernacular work' [11] here to refer to those everyday forms of dance and organized movement that are informal, refractory (resistant to formal analysis), yet are socially reproduced and derived from a commons. The project investigates the notion of vernaculars in movement that is intentional and aesthetic through the development of a computational approach that highlights both similarities and differences, thereby revealing the specificities of each individual mover. This paper presents an example of how this movement database is used as a research tool, and how the fruits of that research can be added back to the database, thus adding a novel layer of annotation and further enriching the collection. Future researchers can then benefit from this layer, further refining and building upon these techniques.The creation of a robust, open source, movement lexicon repository will allow for observation, speculation, and contextualization - along with the provision of clean and complex data sets for new forms of creative expression.},

The 'Mead &amp; Conway methods' were being taught at 100+ universities all over the world, and "not only have helped spawn a common design culture so necessary in the VLSI era, but have greatly increased interaction between university and industry so as to stimulate research by both." Concepts such as simplified design methods, new, electronic representations of digital design data, scalable design rules, 'clean' formalized digital interfaces between design and manufacturing, and widely accessible silicon foundries suddenly enabled many thousands of chip designers to create many tens of thousands of chip designs. Today, as Moore's Law -- a term coined by Carver Mead -- has brought as from 10 microns to 10 nanometers, what is the heritage of Mead &amp; Conway?UCB Professor Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli will moderate an industry and research panel, to discuss what has remained the same, what was missed, what has changed, and what lies ahead.},

However, acquisition of requirements is challenging and inappropriate requirements might lead to unncessary project development cost. It is important to validate the requirements with various possible techniques to design a software solution. It is equally important to choose appropriate techniques for RE. To understand the importance of RE, Energy feedback or visualization of electricity consumption application had been chosen which would help in reducing household electricity consumption by motivating the residential end-users. To design an effective and innovative solution for visualization application, this article used a combination of three RE techniques, viz., systematic literature review (SLR), crowdsourcing survey and user-centred design (UCD) based design activity. The SLR assessed 22 studies, while the crowdsourcing survey and the design activity had 137 and 6 participants respectively. The RE techniques were interdependent and the results from each technique was fed to design the subsequent phases. Each of the RE techniques' motivation, procedure and its results were discussed and were statistically compared with each other forming the top seven features of the system to be developed. This study also analyzed the effectiveness of the requirements elicitation by conducting retrospective on the RE techniques. The retrospective analyzed things that went well, things that did not go well, and things that can be improved. It led to the discussion on how effectively can this process be improved to collect the requirements.},

Due to diabetic complications such as neuropathy, diabetic patients do not feel any pain in their feet. Due to this they are often unaware of any ulcer or wound formed on their feet. This along with impaired healing of the wounds often escalates into lower extremity amputation affecting patient's socio-economic well-being. By monitoring different parameters of the foot and using it for predicting possible occurrence of ulcer we aim to avoid occurrence of ulcers. We developed a new hardware with accompanying software while evaluating the design to ensure it helps in taking early preventive measures for the feet and avoid the occurrence of ulcer and further complications.},

abstract = {Discrete event simulation is an established methodology for investigating the dynamic behavior of complex manufacturing and logistics systems. Traditionally, simulation experts conduct experiments for predetermined system specifications focusing on single model aspects and specific analysis questions. In addition to that, the concept of data farming and knowledge discovery is an ongoing research issue that consists of broad scale experimentation and data mining assisted analysis of massive simulation output data. As an extension to this approach, we propose a concept for investigating the robustness of complex manufacturing and logistic systems which are often very sensitive to variation and noise. Based on Taguchi's loss function, we developed a concept including data farming and visual analytics methodologies to investigate sources of variation in a model and the factor values that make a configuration robust. The concept is demonstrated on an exemplary case study model.},

Projects needs the participation of a pool of companies that have to collaborate in a multidisciplinary and integrated way following a defined PLM strategy.These challenges are meant to introduce a new way of working, based on innovation and global collaboration, both internally among different disciplines and externally between operations, administration, and maintenance and its suppliers. One of the main leverages to achieve this aim is enabling a new business paradigm through pervasive 3D (three dimensions) to support activities from engineering, manufacturing, operations, and inservice domains.Nowadays, products can be designed, simulated, and validated directly in the virtual domain with the help of computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided engineering (CAE), and Digital manufacturing software using 3D interaction and simulation. This new approach adds to traditional product data management (PDM) systems new functionalities to explicitly manage products, processes, and resource objects, as well as the relationships between them, according to configuration and effectiveness.

abstract = {A body of literature on self-tracking has been established in human-computer interaction studies. Contributors to this literature tend to take a cognitive or behavioural psychology approach to theorising and explaining self-tracking. Such an approach is limited to understanding individual behaviour. Yet self-tracking is a profoundly social practice, both in terms of the enculturated meanings with which it is invested and the social encounters and social institutions that are part of the self-tracking phenomenon. In this paper I contend that sociological perspectives can contribute some intriguing possibilities for human-computer interaction research, particularly in developing an understanding of the wider social, cultural and political dimensions of what I refer to as 'self-tracking cultures'. The discussion focuses on the following topics: self-optimisation and governing the self; entanglements of bodies and technologies; the valorisation of data; data doubles; and social inequalities and self-tracking. The paper ends with outlining some directions for future research on self-tracking cultures that goes beyond the individual to the social.},

The Torrent system musifies and physicalizes the flutists' muscle tension as live water sounds and movement that accompany the musicians as they perform. Semi-structured interviews and surveys were conducted to under-stand the experiences of the performers and audience during one performance. The use of embodiment, as integral to the music itself, aspires to emphasize means and end, body and mind, effort and achievement in the struggle of people unit-ed against the elements.},

abstract = {Developing and deploying Web applications on networked embedded devices is often seen as a way to reduce the development cost and time to market for new target platforms. However, the size of the messages and the processing requirements of today's Web protocols, such as HTTP and XML, are challenging for the most resource-constrained class of devices that could also benefit from Web connectivity.New Web protocols using binary representations have been proposed for addressing this issue. Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) reduces the bandwidth and processing requirements compared to HTTP while preserving the core concepts of the Web architecture. Similarly, Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) format has been standardized for reducing the size and processing time for XML structured information. Nevertheless, the adoption of these technologies is lagging behind due to lack of support from Web browsers and current Web development toolkits.Motivated by these problems, this article presents the design and implementation techniques for the EXIP framework for embedded Web development. The framework consists of a highly efficient EXI processor, a tool for EXI data binding based on templates, and a CoAP/EXI/XHTML Web page engine. A prototype implementation of the EXI processor is herein presented and evaluated. It can be applied to Web browsers or thin server platforms using XHTML and Web services for supporting human-machine interactions in the Internet of Things.This article contains four major results: (1) theoretical and practical evaluation of the use of binary protocols for embedded Web programming; (2) a novel method for generation of EXI grammars based on XML Schema definitions; (3) an algorithm for grammar concatenation that produces normalized EXI grammars directly, and hence reduces the number of iterations during grammar generation; (4) an algorithm for efficient representation of possible deviations from the XML schema.},

Modules are equipped with rich input and output capability: touch detection on multiple surfaces, angular detection, visual output, and motor actuation. Each module includes a servo motor wrapped with a flexible circuit board with an embedded microcontroller.Leveraging the modular functionality, we introduce novel interaction capability with shape changing interfaces, such as rearranging the shape/configuration and attaching to passive objects and bodies. To demonstrate the capability and interaction design space of ChainFORM, we implemented a variety of applications for both computer interfaces and hands-on prototyping tools.},

In this paper, we present IdeaWall, a real-time system that continuously extracts essential information from a verbal discussion and augments that information with web-search materials. IdeaWall provides combinatorial visual stimuli to the participants to facilitate their creative process. We develop three cognitive strategies, from which a prototype application with three display modes was designed, implemented, and evaluated. The results of the user study with twelve groups show that IdeaWall effectively presents visual cues to facilitate verbal creative collaboration for idea generation and sets the stage for future research on intelligent systems that assist collaborative work.},

abstract = {In a neural network, the weights act as parameters to determine the output(s) from a set of inputs. The weights are used to find the activation values of nodes of a layer from the values of the previous layer. Finding the ideal set of these weights for training a Multi-layer Perceptron neural network such that it minimizes the classification error is a widely known optimization problem. The presented article proposes a Hybrid Wolf-Bat algorithm, a novel optimization algorithm, as a solution to solve the discussed problem. The proposed algorithm is a hybrid of two already existing nature-inspired algorithms, Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm and Bat algorithm. The novel introduced approach is tested on ten different datasets of the medical field, obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the recently developed nature-inspired algorithms: Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm, Cuckoo Search, Bat Algorithm, and Whale Optimization Algorithm, along with the standard Back-propagation training method available in the literature. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other bio-inspired algorithms in terms of both speed of convergence and accuracy.},

They transition between perceived shapes within milliseconds, require no mechanically moving parts and consume little energy. We build 3D physical interfaces with individually controllable parts by laser cutting and folding a single sheet of transparency-controlled material. Electrical connections are engraved in the surface, eliminating the need for wiring individual parts. We consider our work as complementary to current shape-changing interfaces. While our proposed interfaces do not exhibit dynamic tangible qualities, they have unique benefits such as the ability to create apparent holes or nesting of objects. We explore the benefits of transparency-controlled physical interfaces by characterizing their design space and showcase four physical prototypes: two activity indicators, a playful avatar, and a lamp shade with dynamic appearance.},

In response, we developed MyPart, the first personal, portable, and accurate particle sensor under $50 capable of distinguishing and counting differently sized particles. We demonstrate how MyPart offers substantial enhancements over most existing air particle sensors by simultaneously improving accessibility, flexibility, portability, and accuracy. We describe the evolution and implementation of the sensor design, demonstrate its performance across twenty everyday urban environments versus a calibrated instrument, and conduct a preliminary user study to report on the overall user experience of MyPart. We also present a novel smart-phone visualization interface and a series of simple form factor adaptations of our design.},

We designed an interactive sound installation that supports kinesthetic awareness of a participant's micro-movements. The installation's interaction design uses continuous auditory feedback and leverages an adaptive mapping strategy, refining its sensitivity to increase sonic resolution at lower levels of movement activity. The installation uses field recordings as rich source materials to generate a sound environment that attunes to a participant's micro-movements. Through a qualitative study using a second-person interview technique, we gained nuanced insights into the participants' subjective experiences of the installation. These reveal consistent temporal patterns, as participants build on a gradual process of integration to increase the complexity and capacity of their kinesthetic awareness during interaction.},

This paper aims at understanding the methodological commonalities among startups who are developing Internet-of-Things products. Using the SEMAT Essence framework, we captured common team compositions, common types of Minimum Viable Products and common way of working in early stage Internet-of-Things startups. We found that startups include various engineering and business competence, but do not cover all of what is needed. The development of Internet-of-Things applications adopts certain speed-favor approaches, i.e. rapid prototyping, iterative development and outsourcing. The finding implies some recommendations for both researchers and practitioners in the area of Internet-of-Things development.},

This is a complex planning process involving numerous trade-offs-constraints and factors that often make decisions difficult. Since the success of a product depends on this plan, it is important to understand the trade-offs between different release plans in order to make an informed choice. We present STRATOS, a tool that simultaneously visualizes several software release plans. The visualization shows several attributes about each plan that are important to planners. Multiple plans are shown in a single layout to help planners find and understand the trade-offs between alternative plans. We evaluated our tool via a qualitative study and found that STRATOS enables a range of decision-making processes, helping participants decide on which plan is most optimal.},

These heaters are then used to couple heat and thermoreactive materials in a class of artifacts we term Thermoreactive Composites (TrCs). In a formal user study, we observe how designing fabrication workflows along dimensions of composability and perceivability better matches the working styles of material practitioners without domain knowledge of electronics.

Gaining insight into and understanding of complex data is a highly demanding task for people with visual impairments. Especially in the case of table-based data, the classic approaches of braille-based output devices and printing concepts are limited. Haptic perception requires sequential information processing rather than the parallel processing used by the visual system, which hinders haptic perception to gather a fast overview of and deeper insight into the data. Nevertheless, neuroscientific research has identified great dependencies between haptic perception and the cognitive processing of visual sensing. Based on these findings, we developed a haptic 3D surface representation of classic diagrams and charts, such as bar graphs and pie charts. In a qualitative evaluation study, we identified certain advantages of our relief-type 3D chart approach. Finally, we present an education model for German schools that includes a 3D printing approach to help integrate students with visual impairments.},

abstract = {Recently, a supervised dictionary learning (SDL) approach based on the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) has been proposed that learns the dictionary and the corresponding sparse coefficients in a space where the dependency between the data and the corresponding labels is maximized. In this paper, two multiview dictionary learning techniques are proposed based on this HSIC-based SDL. While one of these two techniques learns one dictionary and the corresponding coefficients in the space of fused features in all views, the other learns one dictionary in each view and subsequently fuses the sparse coefficients in the spaces of learned dictionaries. The effectiveness of the proposed multiview learning techniques in using the complementary information of single views is demonstrated in the application of speech emotion recognition (SER). The fully-continuous sub-challenge (FCSC) of the AVEC 2012 dataset is used in two different views: baseline and spectral energy distribution (SED) feature sets. Four dimensional affects, i.e., arousal, expectation, power, and valence are predicted using the proposed multiview methods as the continuous response variables. The results are compared with the single views, AVEC 2012 baseline system, and also other supervised and unsupervised multiview learning approaches in the literature. Using correlation coefficient as the performance measure in predicting the continuous dimensional affects, it is shown that the proposed approach achieves the highest performance among the rivals. The relative performance of the two proposed multiview techniques and their relationship are also discussed. Particularly, it is shown that by providing an additional constraint on the dictionary of one of these approaches, it becomes the same as the other.},

abstract = {The vision of sensor systems that collect critical and previously ungathered information about the world is often only realized when sensors, students, and subjects move outside the academic laboratory. However, deployments at even the smallest scales introduce complexities and risks that can be difficult for a research team to anticipate. Over the past year, our interdisciplinary team of engineers and economists has been designing, deploying, and operating a large sensor network in Accra, Ghana that measures power outages and quality at households and firms. This network consists of 457 custom sensors, over 3,000 mobile app instances, thousands of participant surveys, and custom user incentive and deployment management systems. In part, this deployment supports an evaluation of the impacts of investments in the grid on reliability and the subsequent effects of improvements in reliability on socioeconomic well-being. We report our experiences as we move from performing small pilot deployments to our current scale, attempting to identify the pain points at each stage of the deployment. Finally, we extract high-level observations and lessons learned from our deployment activities, which we wish we had originally known when forecasting budgets, human resources, and project timelines. These insights will be critical as we look toward scaling our deployment to the entire city of Accra and beyond, and we hope that they will encourage and support other researchers looking to measure highly granular information about our world's critical systems.},

abstract = {The performance of speech emotion recognition is affected by the differences in data distributions between train source domain and test target domain sets used to build and evaluate the models. This is a common problem, as multiple studies have shown that the performance of emotional classifiers drops when they are exposed to data that do not match the distribution used to build the emotion classifiers. The difference in data distributions becomes very clear when the training and testing data come from different domains, causing a large performance gap between development and testing performance. Due to the high cost of annotating new data and the abundance of unlabeled data, it is crucial to extract as much useful information as possible from the available unlabeled data. This study looks into the use of adversarial multitask training to extract a common representation between train and test domains. The primary task is to predict emotional-attribute-based descriptors for arousal, valence, or dominance. The secondary task is to learn a common representation, where the train and test domains cannot be distinguished. By using a gradient reversal layer, the gradients coming from the domain classifier are used to bring the source and target domain representations closer. We show that exploiting unlabeled data consistently leads to better emotion recognition performance across all emotional dimensions. We visualize the effect of adversarial training on the feature representation across the proposed deep learning architecture. The analysis shows that the data representations for the train and test domains converge as the data are passed to deeper layers of the network. We also evaluate the difference in performance when we use a shallow neural network versus a deep neural network and the effect of the number of shared layers used by the task and domain classifiers.},

In order to accelerate the progress of science, computer scientists must understand these problems, needs, and beliefs. To this end, this paper presents a survey of scientists from diverse disciplines, practicing computational science at a doctoral-granting university with very high research activity. The survey covers many things, among them, prevalent programming practices within this scientific community, the importance of computational power in different fields, use of tools to enhance performance and software productivity, computational resources leveraged, and prevalence of parallel computation. The results reveal several patterns that suggest interesting avenues to bridge the gap between scientific researchers and programming tools developers.},

Despite the barriers, an increasing number of Quantified-Selfers diligently track many kinds of data about themselves, and some of them share their best practices and mistakes through Meetup talks, blogging, and conferences. In this work, we aim to gain insights from these "extreme users," who have used existing technologies and built their own workarounds to overcome different barriers. We conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis of 52 video recordings of Quantified Self Meetup talks to understand what they did, how they did it, and what they learned. We highlight several common pitfalls to self-tracking, including tracking too many things, not tracking triggers and context, and insufficient scientific rigor. We identify future research efforts that could help make progress toward addressing these pitfalls. We also discuss how our findings can have broad implications in designing and developing self-tracking technologies.},

abstract = {Research in the Internet of Things (IoT) conceives a world where everyday objects are connected to the Internet and exchange, store, process, and collect data from the surrounding environment. IoT devices are becoming essential for supporting the delivery of data to enable electronic services, but they are not sufficient in most cases to host application services directly due to their intrinsic resource constraints. Fog Computing (FC) can be a suitable paradigm to overcome these limitations, as it can coexist and cooperate with centralized Cloud systems and extends the latter toward the network edge. In this way, it is possible to distribute resources and services of computing, storage, and networking along the Cloud-to-Things continuum. As such, FC brings all the benefits of Cloud Computing (CC) closer to end (user) devices. This article presents a survey on the employment of FC to support IoT devices and services. The principles and literature characterizing FC are described, highlighting six IoT application domains that may benefit from the use of this paradigm. The extension of Cloud systems towards the network edge also creates new challenges and can have an impact on existing approaches employed in Cloud-based deployments. Research directions being adopted by the community are highlighted, with an indication of which of these are likely to have the greatest impact. An overview of existing FC software and hardware platforms for the IoT is also provided, along with the standardisation efforts in this area initiated by the OpenFog Consortium (OFC).},

The Janus objects have special surfaces that have two or more asymmetric physical properties at different areas. In JOLED, they are levitated in mid-air and controllably rotated to reveal their different physical properties. We made voxels by coating the hemispheres of expanded polystyrene beads with different materials, and applied a thin patch of titanium dioxide to induce electrostatic charge on them. Transparent indium tin oxide electrodes are used around the levitation volume to create a tailored electric field to control the orientation of the voxels. We propose a novel method to control the angular position of individual voxels in a grid using electrostatic rotation and their 3D position using acoustic levitation. We present a display in which voxels can be flipped independently, and two mid-air physical games with a voxel as the playable character that moves in 3D across other physical structures and rotates to reflect its status in the games. We demonstrate a voxel update speed of 37.8 ms/flip, which is video-rate.},

abstract = {Understanding mobile traffic patterns of large scale cellular towers in urban environment is extremely valuable for Internet service providers, mobile users, and government managers of modern metropolis. This paper aims at extracting and modeling the traffic patterns of large scale towers deployed in a metropolitan city. To achieve this goal, we need to address several challenges, including lack of appropriate tools for processing large scale traffic measurement data, unknown traffic patterns, as well as handling complicated factors of urban ecology and human behaviors that affect traffic patterns. Our core contribution is a powerful model which combines three dimensional information time, locations of towers, and traffic frequency spectrum to extract and model the traffic patterns of thousands of cellular towers. Our empirical analysis reveals the following important observations. First, only five basic time-domain traffic patterns exist among the 9600 cellular towers. Second, each of the extracted traffic pattern maps to one type of geographical locations related to urban ecology, including residential area, business district, transport, entertainment, and comprehensive area. Third, our frequency-domain traffic spectrum analysis suggests that the traffic of any tower among 9600 can be constructed using a linear combination of four primary components corresponding to human activity behaviors. We believe that the proposed traffic patterns extraction and modeling methodology, combined with the empirical analysis on the mobile traffic, pave the way toward a deep understanding of the traffic patterns of large scale cellular towers in modern metropolis.},

VisIRR effectively combines the paradigms of (1) a passive pull through query processes for retrieval and (2) an active push that recommends items of potential interest to users based on their preferences. Equipped with an efficient dynamic query interface against a large-scale corpus, VisIRR organizes the retrieved documents into high-level topics and visualizes them in a 2D space, representing the relationships among the topics along with their keyword summary. In addition, based on interactive personalized preference feedback with regard to documents, VisIRR provides document recommendations from the entire corpus, which are beyond the retrieved sets. Such recommended documents are visualized in the same space as the retrieved documents, so that users can seamlessly analyze both existing and newly recommended ones. This article presents novel computational methods, which make these integrated representations and fast interactions possible for a large-scale document corpus. We illustrate how the system works by providing detailed usage scenarios. Additionally, we present preliminary user study results for evaluating the effectiveness of the system.},

AudioDAQ differs from existing phone peripheral interfaces by drawing all necessary power from the microphone bias voltage, encoding all data as analog audio, and leveraging the phone's built-in voice memo application (or a custom application) for continuous data collection. These properties make the AudioDAQ design more universal, so it works across a broad range of phones including sophisticated smart phones and simpler feature phones, enables simple analog peripherals without requiring a microcontroller, requires no hardware or software modifications on the phone itself, uses significantly less power than prior approaches, and allows continuous data capture over an extended period of time. The AudioDAQ design is efficient because it draws all necessary power from the microphone bias voltage, and it is general because this voltage and a voice memo application are present on most mobile phones in use today. We show the viability of our architecture by evaluating an end-to-end system that can capture EKG signals continuously for hours and send the data to the cloud for storage, processing, and visualization.},

As an important technology for explaining and understanding complex data, visual analytics has been increasingly introduced into industrial data analysis scenarios. With the durability test of automotive starters as background, this study proposes a visual analysis approach for understanding large-scale and long-term durability test data. Guided by detailed scenario and requirement analyses, we first propose a migration-adapted clustering algorithm that utilizes a segmentation strategy and a group of matching-updating operations to achieve an efficient and accurate clustering analysis of the data for starting mode identification and abnormal test detection. We then design and implement a visual analysis system that provides a set of user-friendly visual designs and lightweight interactions to help people gain data insights into the test process overview, test data patterns, and durability performance dynamics. Finally, we conduct a quantitative algorithm evaluation, case study, and user interview by using real-world starter durability test datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and its possible inspiration for the durability test data analysis of other similar industrial products.},

This has made them undesirable for mobile devices because much of the web content is of bright colors.To tackle this problem, we present the motivational studies, design, and realization of Chameleon, a color adaptive web browser that renders web pages with power-optimized color schemes under user-supplied constraints. Driven by the findings from our motivational studies, Chameleon provides end users with important options, offloads tasks that are not absolutely needed in real-time, and accomplishes real-time tasks by carefully enhancing the codebase of a browser engine. According to measurements with OLED smartphones, Chameleon is able to re-duce average system power consumption for web browsing by 41% and is able to reduce display power consumption by 64% without introducing any noticeable delay.},

abstract = {Reacting to the discussion on global warming, the HCI community has started to explore the design of tools to support responsible energy consumption. An important part of this research focuses on motivating energy savings by providing feedback tools which present consumption metrics interactively. In this line of work, the configuration of feedback has been mainly discussed using cognitive or behavioral factors. This narrow focus, however, misses a highly relevant perspective for the design of technology that supports sustainable lifestyles: to investigate the multiplicity of forms in which individuals or collectives actually consume energy. In this article, we broaden this focus, by taking a phenomenological lens to study how people use off-the-shelf eco-feedback systems in private households to make energy consumption accountable and explainable. By reconstructing accounting practices, we delineate several constitutive elements of the phenomenon of energy usage in daily life. We complement these elements with a description of the sophisticated methods used by people to organize their energy practices and to give a meaning to their energy consumption. We describe these elements and methods, providing examples coming from the fieldwork and uncovering observed strategies to account for consumption. Based on our results, we provide a critical perspective on existing eco-feedback mechanisms and describe several elements for a design rationale for designing support for responsible energy consumption. We argue that interactive feedback systems should not simply be an end, but rather a resource for the construction of the artful practice of making energy consumption accountable.},

abstract = {Machine learning is a powerful lever for developing, improving, and optimizing test methodologies to cope with the demand from the advanced nodes. Ensemble methods are a particular learning paradigm that uses multiple models to boost performance. In this work, ensemble reduction and learning is explored for integrated circuit test and diagnosis. For testing, the proposed method is able to reduce the number of system-level tests without incurring substantial increase in defect escapes or yield losses. Significant cost from test execution and set-up preparation can thereby be saved. Experiments are performed on two designs of commercially fabricated chips, for an overall population of &gt;264,000 chips. The results demonstrate that our method is able to reduce 29.27% and 21.74% of the number of tests for the two chips, respectively, at the cost of very low defect escapes. For failure diagnosis, the framework is able to predict an adequate amount of test data necessary for accurate failure diagnosis. Experiments performed on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms a state-of-the-art work in terms of data-volume reduction. The proposed ensemble-based methodology creates opportunities for improving test and diagnosis efficiency.},

abstract = {Performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems can significantly be improved by integrating further sources of information such as additional modalities, or acoustic channels, or acoustic models. Given the arising problem of information fusion, striking parallels to problems in digital communications are exhibited, where the discovery of the turbo codes by Berrou et al. was a groundbreaking innovation. In this paper, we show ways how to successfully apply the turbo principle to the domain of ASR and thereby provide solutions to the above-mentioned information fusion problem. The contribution of our work is fourfold: First, we review the turbo decoding forward-backward algorithm (FBA), giving detailed insights into turbo ASR, and providing a new interpretation and formulation of the so-called extrinsic information being passed between the recognizers. Second, we present a real-time capable turbo-decoding Viterbi algorithm suitable for practical information fusion and recognition tasks. Then we present simulation results for a multimodal example of information fusion. Finally, we prove the suitability of both our turbo FBA and turbo Viterbi algorithm also for a single-channel multimodel recognition task obtained by using two acoustic feature extraction methods. On a small vocabulary task (challenging, since spelling is included), our proposed turbo ASR approach outperforms even the best reference system on average over all SNR conditions and investigated noise types by a relative word error rate (WER) reduction of 22.4% (audio-visual task) and 18.2% (audio-only task), respectively.},

With the arrival of new technology, algorithms and display methods comes the realization that gains can be made by tailoring output to the intended audience - humans. Human beings have amazingly complex perceptual systems, which have the ability to quickly capture and process vast amounts of complex data. With all its capability however, the Human Visual System (HVS) has some surprising nuances and limitations that can be exploited to the benefit of numerous graphics applications. This short course will provide insight into those aspects of HVS and other perceptual systems that can serve as both a guide and yard-stick to further the development and evaluation of computer graphics imagery and presentations. The literature on perception provides a rich source of knowledge that can be applied to the realm of computer graphics for immediate and direct benefit, generating images that not only exhibit higher quality, but use less time and resources to process. In addition, knowledge of the HVS serves as a guide on how best to present the images to fulfill the application at hand.},

abstract = {The content of this handbook is most appropriate for graduate students and of primary interest to students studying computer science and information technology, human-computer interfaces, mobile and ubiquitous interfaces, affective and behavioral computing, machine learning, and related multidisciplinary majors. When teaching graduate classes with this book, whether in a quarter- or semester-long course, we recommend initially requiring that students spend two weeks reading the introductory textbook, The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces (Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers, Human-Centered Interfaces Synthesis Series, 2015). With this orientation, a graduate class providing an overview of multimodal-multisensor interfaces then could select chapters from the current handbook, distributed across topics in the different sections.As an example, in a 10-week course the remaining 8 weeks might be allocated to reading select chapters on: (1) theory, user modeling, and common modality combinations (2 weeks); (2) prototyping and software tools, signal processing, and architectures (2 weeks); (3) language and dialogue processing (1 week); (4) detection of emotional and cognitive state (2 weeks); and (5) commercialization, future trends, and societal issues (1 week). In a more extended 16-week course, we recommend spending an additional week reading and discussing chapters on each of these five topic areas, as well as an additional week on the introductory textbook, The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces. As an alternative, in a semester-long course in which students will be conducting a project in one target area (e.g., designing multimodal dialogue systems for in-vehicle use), some or all of the additional time in the semester course could be spent: (1) reading a more in-depth collection of handbook chapters on language and dialogue processing (e.g., 2 weeks) and (2) conducting the hands-on project (e.g., 4 weeks).For more tailored versions of a course on multimodal-multisensor interfaces, another approach is to have students read the handbook chapters in relevant sections and then follow up with more targeted and in-depth technical papers. For example, a course intended for a cognitive science audience might start by reading The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces, followed by assigning chapters from the handbook sections on: (1) theory, user modeling, and common modality combinations; (2) multimodal processing of social and emotional information; and (3) multimodal processing of cognition and mental health status. Afterward, the course could teach students different computational and statistical analysis techniques related to these chapters, ideally through demonstration. Students might then be asked to conduct a hands-on project in which they apply one or more analysis methods to multimodal data to build user models or predict mental states.As a second example, a course intended for a computer science audience might also start by reading The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces, followed by assigning chapters on: (1) prototyping and software tools; (2) multimodal signal processing and architectures; and (3) language and dialogue processing. Afterward, students might engage in a hands-on project in which they design, build, and evaluate the performance of a multimodal system.In all of these teaching scenarios, we anticipate that professors will find this handbook to be a particularly comprehensive and valuable current resource for teaching about multimodal-multisensor interfaces.AcknowledgmentsIn the present age, reviewers are one of the most precious commodities on earth. First and foremost, we'd like to thank our dedicated expert reviewers, who provided insightful comments on the chapters and their revisions, sometimes on short notice. This select group included Antonis Argyros (University of Crete, Greece), Vassilis Athitsos (University of Texas at Arlington, USA), Nicholas Cummins (University of Augsburg, Germany), Randall Davis (MIT, USA), Jun Deng (audEERING, Germany), Jing Han (University of Passau, Germany), Anthony Jameson (DFKI, Germany), Michael Johnston (Interactions Corp., USA), Thomas Kehrenberg (University of Sussex, UK), Gil Keren (ZD.B, Germany), Elsa Andrea Kirchner (DFKI, Germany), Stefan Kopp (Bielefeld University, Germany), Marieke Longchamp (Laboratoire de Neurosciences Cognitive, France), Vedhas Pandit (University of Passau, Germany), Diane Pawluk (Virginia Commonwealth University, USA), Jouni Pohjalainen (Jabra), Hesam Sagha (audEERING, Germany), Maximillian Schmitt (University of Augsburg, Germany), Gabriel Skantze (KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden), Zixing Zhang (Imperial College London, UK), and the handbook's main editors.We'd also like to thank the handbook's eminent advisory board, 12 people who provided valuable guidance throughout the project, including suggestions for chapter topics, assistance with expert reviewing, participation on the panel of experts in our challenge topic discussions, and valuable advice.

We are excited to welcome the CSCW community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal during the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portland provides a stimulating environment for our conference.CSCW is the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research methodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design practice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research that advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design of systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our conference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's work, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural diversity of contributors.As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous "revise and resubmit" review process that uses peer review to improve submitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final acceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidance of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW program ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for presentation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In addition, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels.Lili Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on "Conversational AI &amp; Lessons Learned." Our closing plenary will feature Jorge Cham, the creator of PhD Comics, who will talk about, "The Science Gap." We also welcome Paul Luff and Christian Heath from King's College as the recipients of this year's CSCW Lasting Impact award for their influential 1998 paper, "Mobility in Collaboration."},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) can provide our minds with direct access to digital media in a way that seemingly has no limits. However, creating compelling VR experiences is an incredibly complex challenge. When VR is done well, the results are brilliant and pleasurable experiences that go beyond what we can do in the real world. When VR is done badly, not only is the system frustrating to use, but it can result in sickness. There are many causes of bad VR; some failures come from the limitations of technology, but many come from a lack of understanding perception, interaction, design principles, and real users.

Even when VR principles are fully understood, the first implementation is rarely novel and almost never ideal due to the complex nature of VR and the countless possibilities that can be created.

abstract = {We develop a new model and algorithms for machine learning-based learning analytics, which estimate a learner's knowledge of the concepts underlying a domain, and content analytics, which estimate the relationships among a collection of questions and those concepts. Our model represents the probability that a learner provides the correct response to a question in terms of three factors: their understanding of a set of underlying concepts, the concepts involved in each question, and each question's intrinsic difficulty. We estimate these factors given the graded responses to a collection of questions. The underlying estimation problem is ill-posed in general, especially when only a subset of the questions are answered. The key observation that enables a well-posed solution is the fact that typical educational domains of interest involve only a small number of key concepts. Leveraging this observation, we develop both a bi-convex maximum-likelihood-based solution and a Bayesian solution to the resulting SPARse Factor Analysis (SPARFA) problem. We also incorporate user-defined tags on questions to facilitate the interpretability of the estimated factors. Experiments with synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Finally, we make a connection between SPARFA and noisy, binary-valued (1-bit) dictionary learning that is of independent interest.},

abstract = {Extending a shape-driven map to the interior of the input shape and to the surrounding volume is a difficult problem since it typically relies on the integration of shape-based and volumetric information, together with smoothness conditions, interpolating constraints, preservation of feature values at both a local and global level.In this context, this course revises the main out-of-sample approximation schemes for both 3D shapes and d-dimensional data, and provides a unified discussion on the integration of surface- and volume-based shape information. Then, it describes the application of shape-based and volumetric techniques to shape modeling and analysis through the definition of volumetric shape descriptors; shape processing through volumetric parameterization and polycube splines; feature-driven approximation through kernels and radial basis functions.We also discuss the Hamilton's Ricci flow, which is a powerful tool to compute the conformal structure of the shapes and to design Riemannian metrics of manifolds by prescribed curvatures and shape descriptors using conformal welding. We conclude the presentation by discussing applications to shape analysis and medicine, open problems, and future perspectives.},

abstract = {The field of multimedia is unique in offering a rich and dynamic forum for researchers from "traditional" fields to collaborate and develop new solutions and knowledge that transcend the boundaries of individual disciplines. Despite the prolific research activities and outcomes, however, few efforts have been made to develop books that serve as an introduction to the rich spectrum of topics covered by this broad field. A few books are available that either focus on specific subfields or basic background in multimedia. Tutorial-style materials covering the active topics being pursued by the leading researchers at frontiers of the field are currently lacking. In 2015, ACM SIGMM, the special interest group on multimedia, launched a new initiative to address this void by selecting and inviting 12 rising-star speakers from different subfields of multimedia research to deliver plenary tutorial-style talks at the ACM Multimedia conference for 2015. Each speaker discussed the challenges and state-of-the-art developments of their prospective research areas in a general manner to the broad community. The covered topics were comprehensive, including multimedia content understanding, multimodal human-human and human-computer interaction, multimedia social media, and multimedia system architecture and deployment.  Following the very positive responses to these talks, the speakers were invited to expand the content covered in their talks into chapters that can be used as reference material for researchers, students, and practitioners. Each chapter discusses the problems, technical challenges, state-of-the-art approaches and performances, open issues, and promising direction for future work. Collectively, the chapters provide an excellent sampling of major topics addressed by the community as a whole. This book, capturing some of the outcomes of such efforts, is well positioned to fill the aforementioned needs in providing tutorial-style reference materials for frontier topics in multimedia.}

It provides a textbook, reference, and technology roadmap for professionals working in this and related areas.This third volume focuses on state-of-the-art multimodal language and dialogue processing, including semantic integration of modalities. The development of increasingly expressive embodied agents and robots has become an active test-bed for coordinating multimodal dialogue input and output, including processing of language and nonverbal communication. In addition, major application areas are featured for commercializing multimodal-multisensor systems, including automotive, robotic, manufacturing, machine translation, banking, communications, and others. These systems rely heavily on software tools, data resources, and international standards to facilitate their development. For insights into the future, emerging multimodal-multisensor technology trends are highlighted for medicine, robotics, interaction with smart spaces, and similar topics. Finally, this volume discusses the societal impact of more widespread adoption of these systems, such as privacy risks and how to mitigate them. The handbook chapters provide a number of walk-through examples of system design and processing, information on practical resources for developing and evaluating new systems, and terminology and tutorial support for mastering this emerging field. In the final section of this volume, experts exchange views on a timely and controversial challenge topic, and how they believe multimodal-multisensor interfaces need to be equipped to most effectively advance human performance during the next decade.}

isbn = {9781970001877},
publisher = {Association for Computing Machinery and Morgan &amp; Claypool},
abstract = { “Communities of Computing” is the first book-length history of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), founded in 1947 and with a membership today of 100,000 worldwide. It profiles ACM's notable SIGs, active chapters, and individual members, setting ACM's history into a rich social and political context. The book's 12 core chapters are organized into three thematic sections. “Defining the Discipline” examines the 1960s and 1970s when the field of computer science was taking form at the National Science Foundation, Stanford University, and through ACM's notable efforts in education and curriculum standards.  “Broadening the Profession” looks outward into the wider society as ACM engaged with social and political issues-and as members struggled with balancing a focus on scientific issues and awareness of the wider world. Chapters examine the social turbulence surrounding the Vietnam War, debates about the women's movement, efforts for computing and community education, and international issues including professionalization and the Cold War.  “Expanding Research Frontiers” profiles three areas of research activity where ACM members and ACM itself shaped notable advances in computing, including computer graphics, computer security, and hypertext.  Featuring insightful profiles of notable ACM leaders, such as Edmund Berkeley, George Forsythe, Jean Sammet, Peter Denning, and Kelly Gotlieb, and honest assessments of controversial episodes, the volume deals with compelling and complex issues involving ACM and computing. It is not a narrow organizational history of ACM committees and SIGs, although much information about them is given. All chapters are original works of research. Many chapters draw on archival records of ACM's headquarters, ACM SIGs, and ACM leaders. This volume makes a permanent contribution to documenting the history of ACM and understanding its central role in the history of computing. }

Volume 1 of the handbook presents relevant theory and neuroscience foundations for guiding the development of high-performance systems. Additional chapters discuss approaches to user modeling, interface design that supports user choice, synergistic combination of modalities with sensors, and blending of multimodal input and output. They also highlight an in-depth look at the most common multimodal-multisensor combinations- for example, touch and pen input, haptic and non-speech audio output, and speech co-processed with visible lip movements, gaze, gestures, or pen input. A common theme throughout is support for mobility and individual differences among users-including the world's rapidly growing population of seniors.    These handbook chapters provide walk-through examples and video illustrations of different system designs and their interactive use. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal-multisensor systems. In the final chapter, experts exchange views on a timely and controversial challenge topic, and how they believe multimodal-multisensor interfaces should be designed in the future to most effectively advance human performance. }

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) can provide our minds with direct access to digital media in a way that seemingly has no limits. However, creating compelling VR experiences is an incredibly complex challenge. When VR is done well, the results are brilliant and pleasurable experiences that go beyond what we can do in the real world. When VR is done badly, not only is the system frustrating to use, but it can result in sickness. There are many causes of bad VR; some failures come from the limitations of technology, but many come from a lack of understanding perception, interaction, design principles, and real users. This book discusses these issues by emphasizing the human element of VR. The fact is, if we do not get the human element correct, then no amount of technology will make VR anything more than an interesting tool confined to research laboratories. Even when VR principles are fully understood, the first implementation is rarely novel and almost never ideal due to the complex nature of VR and the countless possibilities that can be created. The VR principles discussed in this book will enable readers to intelligently experiment with the rules and iteratively design towards innovative experiences.}

This year's conference is being held in the beautiful cultural capital of Australia, Melbourne. During the Gold Rush period of the 19th Century, Melbourne was the richest city in the world, and as a result it is filled with many unique neighborhoods and distinctive buildings. In addition to wonderful neighborhoods to explore, the city has great museums and other cultural attractions, as well as a fine multi-cultural atmosphere. For those who would like to explore the outdoors, popular highlights are the Phillip Island Nature Park (90 minutes away), which features wild penguins who return in a parade each day at sunset, and the Great Ocean Road, one of the world's most scenic coastal drives, including the famous towering 12 Apostles.SIGMOD 2015's exciting technical program reflects not only traditional topics, but the database community's role in broader data science and data analytics. The keynote from Laura Haas, "The Power Behind the Throne: Information Integration in the Age of Data-Driven Discovery" highlights the role of database and data integration techniques in the growing field of data science. Jignesh Patel's talk, "From Data to Insights @ Bare Metal Speed," explains how hardware and software need to be co-evolved to support the needs of scalable data analytics. Jennifer Widom, winner of the 2015 ACM-W Athena Lecturer Award for fundamental contributions to computer science, will give her award talk, "Three Favorite Results," on Tuesday. Christopher R\'{e} will lead a panel on "Machine Learning and Databases: The Sound of Things to Come or a Cacophony of Hype?," with participants Divyakant Agrawal, Magdalena Balazinska, Michael Cafarella, Michael Jordan, Tim Kraska, and Raghu Ramakrishnan. Of course, there are also 106 research paper presentations, 4 tutorials, 30 demonstrations, and 18 industrial papers. Papers will be presented both as talks during the research sessions, and as part of plenary Poster Sessions.SIGMOD 2015 is preceded by the PhD Workshop, as well as workshops on leading-edge topics like data analytics (DanaC), databases and the Web (WebDB), exploratory search (ExploreDB), managing and mining spatial data (GeoRich), and graph data (GRADES); the New Researcher Symposium will take place on Wednesday. The banquet will be held in a Melbourne landmark, the Town Hall.As in recent years, we had two submission deadlines for SIGMOD this year, one in August and one in November. The review process was journal-style, with multiple rounds of reviews coordinated by the Group Leaders. We accepted 34 of 137 papers from the first deadline and 72 of 278 from the second deadline. The total acceptance rate was about 25.5%, and we believe that the revision processhas improved the quality of the technical program.},

This is an annual public holiday that commemorates the coronation in 1253 of Mindaugas as the first and only King of Lithuania. The conference venue is the Parliament buildings (Seimas) of the Republic of Lithuania, and the conference dinner is to served in the reconstructed Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, one of the most famous in Europe in the 15--17th centuries. ITiCSE 2015 is hosted by Vilnius University, one of the oldest and most famous establishments of higher education in Eastern and Central Europe, founded in 1579. The conference organizers represent the Lithuanian research group of Informatics and Informatics Engineering Didactics at the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics of Vilnius University.This conference brings together delegates from all over the world to address pressing issues in computing education. In addition to invited lectures, papers, panels, posters, and tips, techniques &amp; courseware sessions, the conference provides facilities and exposure for working groups and exhibitions.The conference continues to be truly international with a total of 170 submissions from 40 countries on six continents, with authors from Africa (4), Asia (50), Europe (151), North America (119), Oceania (51), and South America (17). These submissions consisted of 124 research papers, 1 panel, 9 working group proposals, and 36 proposals for posters or for tips, techniques &amp; courseware.All research papers were double blind reviewed by at least four reviewers, though most papers received five or six reviews. A meta-review was conducted by the members of the conference committee to ensure the reliability of the reviews and to make recommendations to the chairs. A final selection phase was conducted by the program chairs who reviewed all reviews and meta-review recommendations before making their final decisions. As a result of this process, 54 research papers (43.5%) were selected for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings. The authors of the accepted papers come from 17 different countries on five continents.All poster submissions were blind reviewed by two members of the conference committee, and tips, techniques &amp; courseware submissions were blind reviewed by three members of the conference committee. Submissions in these categories were then reviewed by the conference chair before selection by the program chairs for final inclusion in the conference. Twenty-four were accepted, representing authors from 15 countries.The two keynote speakers address the learning of programming and computational thinking. Professor Mordechai (Moti) Ben-Ari from the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, will give a talk titled In Defense of Programming, which defends the (perhaps controversial) position that programming is the fundamental activity of CS. In the other keynote talk Professor Maciej M. Syslo from Nicolaus Copernicus University and University of Wroc\l{}aw, Poland, will address algorithmic nand computational thinking as the way to computing for all students.ITiCSE is famous for its working groups. Participating in a working group provides a unique opportunity to work with people from different countries who are interested and knowledgeable in the area of the working group. It is also one of the best ways to become part of the ITiCSE community. Seven working groups have been accepted over a broad spectrum of topics. The working groups range from general topics, such as computing education terminology, CS education in K-9 and K-12 schools, and designing an IT curriculum framework for graduates in 2025, to more specific topics such as developing a repository for high school CS questions, visual assessment tools and metadata annotations, and how students construct solutions to programming problems. The leaders of the accepted working groups come from over 13 countries.Welcome to Vilnius and enjoy the vicennial ITiCSE conference and Lithuania's Statehood Day!},
