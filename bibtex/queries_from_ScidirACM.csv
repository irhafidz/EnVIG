Urban computing aims to tackle these issues by using the data that has been generated in cities (e.g., traffic flow, human mobility, and geographical data). Urban computing connects urban sensing, data management, data analytics, and service providing into a recurrent process for an unobtrusive and continuous improvement of people's lives, city operation systems, and the environment. Urban computing is an interdisciplinary field where computer sciences meet conventional city-related fields, like transportation, civil engineering, environment, economy, ecology, and sociology in the context of urban spaces. This article first introduces the concept of urban computing, discussing its general framework and key challenges from the perspective of computer sciences. Second, we classify the applications of urban computing into seven categories, consisting of urban planning, transportation, the environment, energy, social, economy, and public safety and security, presenting representative scenarios in each category. Third, we summarize the typical technologies that are needed in urban computing into four folds, which are about urban sensing, urban data management, knowledge fusion across heterogeneous data, and urban data visualization. Finally, we give an outlook on the future of urban computing, suggesting a few research topics that are somehow missing in the community.",2014-09,8/19/2020 6:59,8/19/2020 6:59,,,,3,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery,,,,Urban computing; Big data; City dynamics; Computing with heterogeneous data; Human mobility; Knowledge fusion; Trajectories; Urban informatics; Urban sensing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work we discuss the importance of the smart grid technologies in an ecodistrict development and the theoretical approaches for modeling smart grid and ecodistrict. Further more, we propose an agent-based model of ecodistricts with smart grid elements, by following a modeling approach called ASPECS.

Smart homes have emerged as one of the applications of Internet of Things (IoT) that enabled the use of technology to automate and customize home services with reference to users' preferences. However, the concept of smart homes is still not fully matured due to the weak handling of diverse datasets that can be exploited to promote more adaptive, personalised, and context aware capabilities. Furthermore, instead of just deploying integrated automated services in the homes, the focus should be to bring the concerns of potential stakeholders into consideration. In this paper, we have exploited the concepts of ontologies to capture all sorts of data (classes and their subclasses) that belong to one domain based on stakeholders' requirements analysis. We have also explored their significant associations with other datasets from another domain.

Evolution of the mentioned dashboard is presented using three different case study regions based on data availability and its urban scale: 1) Landkreis Ludwigsburg - A district in Baden Württemberg, Germany showing static urban energy data of specific heating demand 2) Brooklyn - A borough in New York City showing urban energy data of specific heating demand (incl. domestic hot water) over a temporal resolution of 5 years and 3) Wüstenrot - A small municipality in Germany showing real-time dynamic energy data streaming from sensors integrated into a 3D city model.

However, these services must scale in order to meet the fundamental needs of society. To enable such scaling, the total cost of ownership of the data centers that host the services and comprise the vast majority of service delivery costs will need to be reduced. As energy drives the total cost of ownership of data centers, there is a need for a new paradigm in design and management of data centers that minimizes energy used across their lifetimes, from “cradle to cradle”. This tutorial article presents a blueprint for a “net-zero data center”: one that offsets any electricity used from the grid via adequate on-site power generation that gets fed back to the grid at a later time. We discuss how such a data center addresses the total cost of ownership, illustrating that contrary to the oft-held view of sustainability as “paying more to be green”, sustainable data centers—built on a framework that focuses on integrating supply and demand management from end-to-end—can concurrently lead to lowest cost and lowest environmental impact.",2012-10,8/19/2020 6:59,8/19/2020 6:59,,1–39,,4,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such devices can be deployed in a laboratory or “in the wild” in natural environments. The latter allows one to collect behavioral data that is not contaminated by the artificiality of a laboratory experiment. Using IoT devices in ordinary environments also brings the benefits of reduced cost, as compared with lab experiments, and less disturbance to the participants' daily routines, which in turn helps with recruiting them into the research. However, in this case, it is essential to have an IoT infrastructure that can be easily and swiftly installed and from which real-time data can be securely and straightforwardly collected. In this article, we present MakeSense, an IoT testbed that enables real-world experimentation for large-scale social research on indoor activities through real-time monitoring and/or situation-aware applications.

Highly influential in literature and visual arts, it has adapted to the sensibilities of changing times and objects of study. A new understanding of the concept has emerged today: the data sublime. From data visualizations to mass surveillance, the moniker data sublime has been used in the past decade to refer to the abstract manifestations of information technology in the everyday. This expression of sublimity foregrounds data as a form that is virtual, transcendent and beyond the reach of the sense apparatus. Yet data as an artifact is indelibly written and recorded by human hands. What urban representations might this paradox render possible? Are dataspaces myths or the experience of real places?

However, the existing IIC classification techniques are shown to be not accurate and robust enough for clinical use because of the lack of high quality labels of EEG segments as training data. Obtaining high-quality labeled data is traditionally a manual process by trained clinicians that can be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone. In this work, we propose Smile, an industrial scale system that provides an end-to-end solution to the IIC pattern classification problem. The core components of Smile include a visualization-based time series labeling module and a deep-learning based active learning module. The labeling module enables the users to explore and label 350 million EEG segments (30TB) at interactive speed. The multiple coordinated views allow the users to examine the EEG signals from both time domain and frequency domain simultaneously. The active learning module first trains a deep neural network that automatically extracts both the local features with respect to each segment itself and the long term dynamics of the EEG signals to classify IIC patterns. Then leveraging the output of the deep learning model, the EEG segments that can best improve the model are selected and prompted to clinicians to label. This process is iterated until the clinicians and the models show high degree of agreement. Our initial experimental results show that our Smile system allows the clinicians to label the EEG segments at will with a response time below 500 ms. The accuracy of the model is progressively improved as more and more high quality labels are acquired over time.",2019-08,8/19/2020 6:59,8/19/2020 6:59,,2230–2241,,12,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: VLDB Endowment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, understanding sensor data can be a challenge, because it is voluminous, multi-sourced, and unintelligible. Nonetheless, intelligent systems, such as activity recognition, require pattern analysis of sensor data streams to produce compelling results; machine learning (ML) applications enable this type of analysis. However, the number of ML experts able to proficiently classify sensor data is limited, and there remains a lack of interactive, usable tools to help intermediate users perform this type of analysis. To learn which features these tools must support, we conducted interviews with intermediate users of ML and conducted two probe-based studies with a prototype ML and visual analytics system, Gimlets. Our system implements ML applications for sensor-based time-series data as a novel domain-specific prototype that integrates interactive visual analytic features into the ML pipeline.

When agents self-determine options from which they choose, for instance, their resource consumption and production, while these choices have a collective systemwide impact, optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known as NP-hard. In such challenging computational problems, centrally managed (deep) learning systems often require personal data with implications on privacy and citizens' autonomy. This article envisions an alternative unsupervised and decentralized collective learning approach that preserves privacy, autonomy, and participation of multi-agent systems self-organized into a hierarchical tree structure. Remote interactions orchestrate a highly efficient process for decentralized collective learning.

Strikingly, I-EPOS outperforms related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange full information.

Apart from people with breadth and depth of knowledge and experience in data science, we identify a new educational path to train ""bridge persons"" who combine knowledge of an organization's business with sufficient knowledge and understanding of data science to ""bridge"" between non-technical people in the business with highly skilled data scientists who add value to the business. The increasing proliferation of big data and the great advances made in data science do not herald in an era where all problems can be solved by deep learning and artificial intelligence. Although data science opens up many commercial and social opportunities, data science must complement other science in the search for new theory and methods to understand and manage our complex world.",2018-07,8/19/2020 6:59,8/19/2020 6:59,,,,July,2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The surface is made of a highly stretchable pure spandex fabric that is electrostatically actuated using electrodes mounted on its top or underside. It uses transparent indium tin oxide electrodes and high-voltage modulation to create controlled surface deformations. Our setup actuates pixels and creates deformations in the fabric up to +/- 5 mm. Since the electrodes are transparent, the fabric surface functions as a diffuser for rear-projected visual images, and avoid occlusion by users or actuators. Users can touch and interact with the fabric to experience expressive interactions as with any fabric based shape-changing interface. By using frequency modulation in the high-voltage circuit, it can also create localized tactile sensations on the user's fingertip when touching the surface. We provide simulation and experimental results for the shape of the deformation and frequency of the vibration of the surface. These results can be used to build prototypes of different sizes and form-factors. We present a working prototype of TableHop that has 30x40 cm2 surface area and uses a grid of 3x3 transparent electrodes. It uses a maximum of 9.46 mW and can create tactile vibrations of up to 20 Hz. TableHop can be scaled to make large interactive surfaces and integrated with other objects and devices.

To understand the importance of RE, Energy feedback or visualization of electricity consumption application had been chosen which would help in reducing household electricity consumption by motivating the residential end-users. To design an effective and innovative solution for visualization application, this article used a combination of three RE techniques, viz., systematic literature review (SLR), crowdsourcing survey and user-centred design (UCD) based design activity. The SLR assessed 22 studies, while the crowdsourcing survey and the design activity had 137 and 6 participants respectively. The RE techniques were interdependent and the results from each technique was fed to design the subsequent phases. Each of the RE techniques' motivation, procedure and its results were discussed and were statistically compared with each other forming the top seven features of the system to be developed. This study also analyzed the effectiveness of the requirements elicitation by conducting retrospective on the RE techniques.

However, the size of the messages and the processing requirements of today's Web protocols, such as HTTP and XML, are challenging for the most resource-constrained class of devices that could also benefit from Web connectivity.New Web protocols using binary representations have been proposed for addressing this issue. Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) reduces the bandwidth and processing requirements compared to HTTP while preserving the core concepts of the Web architecture. Similarly, Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) format has been standardized for reducing the size and processing time for XML structured information. Nevertheless, the adoption of these technologies is lagging behind due to lack of support from Web browsers and current Web development toolkits.Motivated by these problems, this article presents the design and implementation techniques for the EXIP framework for embedded Web development. The framework consists of a highly efficient EXI processor, a tool for EXI data binding based on templates, and a CoAP/EXI/XHTML Web page engine.

Especially in the case of table-based data, the classic approaches of braille-based output devices and printing concepts are limited. Haptic perception requires sequential information processing rather than the parallel processing used by the visual system, which hinders haptic perception to gather a fast overview of and deeper insight into the data.

In this paper, two multiview dictionary learning techniques are proposed based on this HSIC-based SDL. While one of these two techniques learns one dictionary and the corresponding coefficients in the space of fused features in all views, the other learns one dictionary in each view and subsequently fuses the sparse coefficients in the spaces of learned dictionaries. The effectiveness of the proposed multiview learning techniques in using the complementary information of single views is demonstrated in the application of speech emotion recognition (SER). The fully-continuous sub-challenge (FCSC) of the AVEC 2012 dataset is used in two different views: baseline and spectral energy distribution (SED) feature sets. Four dimensional affects, i.e., arousal, expectation, power, and valence are predicted using the proposed multiview methods as the continuous response variables. The results are compared with the single views, AVEC 2012 baseline system, and also other supervised and unsupervised multiview learning approaches in the literature. Using correlation coefficient as the performance measure in predicting the continuous dimensional affects, it is shown that the proposed approach achieves the highest performance among the rivals. The relative performance of the two proposed multiview techniques and their relationship are also discussed.

This is a common problem, as multiple studies have shown that the performance of emotional classifiers drops when they are exposed to data that do not match the distribution used to build the emotion classifiers. The difference in data distributions becomes very clear when the training and testing data come from different domains, causing a large performance gap between development and testing performance. Due to the high cost of annotating new data and the abundance of unlabeled data, it is crucial to extract as much useful information as possible from the available unlabeled data. This study looks into the use of adversarial multitask training to extract a common representation between train and test domains. The primary task is to predict emotional-attribute-based descriptors for arousal, valence, or dominance. The secondary task is to learn a common representation, where the train and test domains cannot be distinguished. By using a gradient reversal layer, the gradients coming from the domain classifier are used to bring the source and target domain representations closer. We show that exploiting unlabeled data consistently leads to better emotion recognition performance across all emotional dimensions. We visualize the effect of adversarial training on the feature representation across the proposed deep learning architecture. The analysis shows that the data representations for the train and test domains converge as the data are passed to deeper layers of the network. We also evaluate the difference in performance when we use a shallow neural network versus a deep neural network and the effect of the number of shared layers used by the task and domain classifiers.",2018-12,8/19/2020 6:59,8/19/2020 6:59,,2423–2435,,12,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: IEEE Press,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IoT devices are becoming essential for supporting the delivery of data to enable electronic services, but they are not sufficient in most cases to host application services directly due to their intrinsic resource constraints. Fog Computing (FC) can be a suitable paradigm to overcome these limitations, as it can coexist and cooperate with centralized Cloud systems and extends the latter toward the network edge. In this way, it is possible to distribute resources and services of computing, storage, and networking along the Cloud-to-Things continuum. As such, FC brings all the benefits of Cloud Computing (CC) closer to end (user) devices. This article presents a survey on the employment of FC to support IoT devices and services. The principles and literature characterizing FC are described, highlighting six IoT application domains that may benefit from the use of this paradigm. The extension of Cloud systems towards the network edge also creates new challenges and can have an impact on existing approaches employed in Cloud-based deployments.

To achieve this goal, we need to address several challenges, including lack of appropriate tools for processing large scale traffic measurement data, unknown traffic patterns, as well as handling complicated factors of urban ecology and human behaviors that affect traffic patterns. Our core contribution is a powerful model which combines three dimensional information time, locations of towers, and traffic frequency spectrum to extract and model the traffic patterns of thousands of cellular towers. Our empirical analysis reveals the following important observations. First, only five basic time-domain traffic patterns exist among the 9600 cellular towers. Second, each of the extracted traffic pattern maps to one type of geographical locations related to urban ecology, including residential area, business district, transport, entertainment, and comprehensive area. Third, our frequency-domain traffic spectrum analysis suggests that the traffic of any tower among 9600 can be constructed using a linear combination of four primary components corresponding to human activity behaviors.

In this line of work, the configuration of feedback has been mainly discussed using cognitive or behavioral factors. This narrow focus, however, misses a highly relevant perspective for the design of technology that supports sustainable lifestyles: to investigate the multiplicity of forms in which individuals or collectives actually consume energy. In this article, we broaden this focus, by taking a phenomenological lens to study how people use off-the-shelf eco-feedback systems in private households to make energy consumption accountable and explainable. By reconstructing accounting practices, we delineate several constitutive elements of the phenomenon of energy usage in daily life. We complement these elements with a description of the sophisticated methods used by people to organize their energy practices and to give a meaning to their energy consumption. We describe these elements and methods, providing examples coming from the fieldwork and uncovering observed strategies to account for consumption. Based on our results, we provide a critical perspective on existing eco-feedback mechanisms and describe several elements for a design rationale for designing support for responsible energy consumption.

For testing, the proposed method is able to reduce the number of system-level tests without incurring substantial increase in defect escapes or yield losses. Significant cost from test execution and set-up preparation can thereby be saved. Experiments are performed on two designs of commercially fabricated chips, for an overall population of >264,000 chips. The results demonstrate that our method is able to reduce 29.27% and 21.74% of the number of tests for the two chips, respectively, at the cost of very low defect escapes. For failure diagnosis, the framework is able to predict an adequate amount of test data necessary for accurate failure diagnosis. Experiments performed on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms a state-of-the-art work in terms of data-volume reduction. The proposed ensemble-based methodology creates opportunities for improving test and diagnosis efficiency.",2019-06,8/19/2020 6:59,8/19/2020 6:59,,,,5,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery",,,,machine learning; diagnosis; ensemble reduction; Integrated system test; logic minimization; test economics; test-set reduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the arising problem of information fusion, striking parallels to problems in digital communications are exhibited, where the discovery of the turbo codes by Berrou et al. was a groundbreaking innovation. In this paper, we show ways how to successfully apply the turbo principle to the domain of ASR and thereby provide solutions to the above-mentioned information fusion problem. The contribution of our work is fourfold: First, we review the turbo decoding forward-backward algorithm (FBA), giving detailed insights into turbo ASR, and providing a new interpretation and formulation of the so-called extrinsic information being passed between the recognizers. Second, we present a real-time capable turbo-decoding Viterbi algorithm suitable for practical information fusion and recognition tasks. Then we present simulation results for a multimodal example of information fusion. Finally, we prove the suitability of both our turbo FBA and turbo Viterbi algorithm also for a single-channel multimodel recognition task obtained by using two acoustic feature extraction methods. On a small vocabulary task (challenging, since spelling is included), our proposed turbo ASR approach outperforms even the best reference system on average over all SNR conditions and investigated noise types by a relative word error rate (WER) reduction of 22.4% (audio-visual task) and 18.2% (audio-only task), respectively.",2016-05,8/19/2020 6:59,8/19/2020 6:59,,846–862,,5,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: IEEE Press,,,,speech recognition; hidden Markov models; multimedia systems; iterative decoding; robustness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are excited to welcome the CSCW community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal during the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portland provides a stimulating environment for our conference.CSCW is the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research methodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design practice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research that advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design of systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our conference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's work, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural diversity of contributors.As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous ""revise and resubmit"" review process that uses peer review to improve submitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final acceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidance of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW program ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for presentation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In addition, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels.Lili Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on ""Conversational AI & Lessons Learned."" Our closing plenary will feature Jorge Cham, the creator of PhD Comics, who will talk about, ""The Science Gap."" We also welcome Paul Luff and Christian Heath from King's College as the recipients of this year's CSCW Lasting Impact award for their influential 1998 paper, ""Mobility in Collaboration.""",2017,8/19/2020 6:59,8/19/2020 6:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, creating compelling VR experiences is an incredibly complex challenge. When VR is done well, the results are brilliant and pleasurable experiences that go beyond what we can do in the real world. When VR is done badly, not only is the system frustrating to use, but it can result in sickness. There are many causes of bad VR; some failures come from the limitations of technology, but many come from a lack of understanding perception, interaction, design principles, and real users. This book discusses these issues by emphasizing the human element of VR. The fact is, if we do not get the human element correct, then no amount of technology will make VR anything more than an interesting tool confined to research laboratories. Even when VR principles are fully understood, the first implementation is rarely novel and almost never ideal due to the complex nature of VR and the countless possibilities that can be created. The VR principles discussed in this book will enable readers to intelligently experiment with the rules and iteratively design towards innovative experiences.",,8/19/2020 6:59,8/19/2020 6:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery and Morgan & Claypool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Res.,,1532-4435,,,"We develop a new model and algorithms for machine learning-based learning analytics, which estimate a learner's knowledge of the concepts underlying a domain, and content analytics, which estimate the relationships among a collection of questions and those concepts. Our model represents the probability that a learner provides the correct response to a question in terms of three factors: their understanding of a set of underlying concepts, the concepts involved in each question, and each question's intrinsic difficulty. We estimate these factors given the graded responses to a collection of questions. The underlying estimation problem is ill-posed in general, especially when only a subset of the questions are answered. The key observation that enables a well-posed solution is the fact that typical educational domains of interest involve only a small number of key concepts. Leveraging this observation, we develop both a bi-convex maximum-likelihood-based solution and a Bayesian solution to the resulting SPARse Factor Analysis (SPARFA) problem. We also incorporate user-defined tags on questions to facilitate the interpretability of the estimated factors. Experiments with synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Finally, we make a connection between SPARFA and noisy, binary-valued (1-bit) dictionary learning that is of independent interest.",2014-01,8/19/2020 6:59,8/19/2020 6:59,,1959–2008,,1,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: JMLR.org,,,,Bayesian latent factor analysis; factor analysis; personalized learning; sparse logistic regression; sparse probit regression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

book,2017,,Frontiers of Multimedia Research,,978-1-970001-07-5,,,,"The field of multimedia is unique in offering a rich and dynamic forum for researchers from ""traditional"" fields to collaborate and develop new solutions and knowledge that transcend the boundaries of individual disciplines. Despite the prolific research activities and outcomes, however, few efforts have been made to develop books that serve as an introduction to the rich spectrum of topics covered by this broad field. A few books are available that either focus on specific subfields or basic background in multimedia. Tutorial-style materials covering the active topics being pursued by the leading researchers at frontiers of the field are currently lacking. In 2015, ACM SIGMM, the special interest group on multimedia, launched a new initiative to address this void by selecting and inviting 12 rising-star speakers from different subfields of multimedia research to deliver plenary tutorial-style talks at the ACM Multimedia conference for 2015. Each speaker discussed the challenges and state-of-the-art developments of their prospective research areas in a general manner to the broad community. The covered topics were comprehensive, including multimedia content understanding, multimodal human-human and human-computer interaction, multimedia social media, and multimedia system architecture and deployment. Following the very positive responses to these talks, the speakers were invited to expand the content covered in their talks into chapters that can be used as reference material for researchers, students, and practitioners. Each chapter discusses the problems, technical challenges, state-of-the-art approaches and performances, open issues, and promising direction for future work. Collectively, the chapters provide an excellent sampling of major topics addressed by the community as a whole. This book, capturing some of the outcomes of such efforts, is well positioned to fill the aforementioned needs in providing tutorial-style reference materials for frontier topics in multimedia.",2017,8/19/2020 6:59,8/19/2020 6:59,,,,,17,,,,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery and Morgan & Claypool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chang, Shih-Fu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It profiles ACM's notable SIGs, active chapters, and individual members, setting ACM's history into a rich social and political context. The book's 12 core chapters are organized into three thematic sections. “Defining the Discipline” examines the 1960s and 1970s when the field of computer science was taking form at the National Science Foundation, Stanford University, and through ACM's notable efforts in education and curriculum standards. “Broadening the Profession” looks outward into the wider society as ACM engaged with social and political issues-and as members struggled with balancing a focus on scientific issues and awareness of the wider world. Chapters examine the social turbulence surrounding the Vietnam War, debates about the women's movement, efforts for computing and community education, and international issues including professionalization and the Cold War. “Expanding Research Frontiers” profiles three areas of research activity where ACM members and ACM itself shaped notable advances in computing, including computer graphics, computer security, and hypertext. Featuring insightful profiles of notable ACM leaders, such as Edmund Berkeley, George Forsythe, Jean Sammet, Peter Denning, and Kelly Gotlieb, and honest assessments of controversial episodes, the volume deals with compelling and complex issues involving ACM and computing. It is not a narrow organizational history of ACM committees and SIGs, although much information about them is given. All chapters are original works of research.

However, creating compelling VR experiences is an incredibly complex challenge. When VR is done well, the results are brilliant and pleasurable experiences that go beyond what we can do in the real world. When VR is done badly, not only is the system frustrating to use, but it can result in sickness. There are many causes of bad VR; some failures come from the limitations of technology, but many come from a lack of understanding perception, interaction, design principles, and real users. This book discusses these issues by emphasizing the human element of VR. The fact is, if we do not get the human element correct, then no amount of technology will make VR anything more than an interesting tool confined to research laboratories. Even when VR principles are fully understood, the first implementation is rarely novel and almost never ideal due to the complex nature of VR and the countless possibilities that can be created.

book,2015,,SIGMOD '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,,978-1-4503-2758-9,,,,"Welcome to SIGMOD 2015 – officially, the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on the Management of Data! This year's conference is being held in the beautiful cultural capital of Australia, Melbourne. During the Gold Rush period of the 19th Century, Melbourne was the richest city in the world, and as a result it is filled with many unique neighborhoods and distinctive buildings. In addition to wonderful neighborhoods to explore, the city has great museums and other cultural attractions, as well as a fine multi-cultural atmosphere. For those who would like to explore the outdoors, popular highlights are the Phillip Island Nature Park (90 minutes away), which features wild penguins who return in a parade each day at sunset, and the Great Ocean Road, one of the world's most scenic coastal drives, including the famous towering 12 Apostles.SIGMOD 2015's exciting technical program reflects not only traditional topics, but the database community's role in broader data science and data analytics. The keynote from Laura Haas, ""The Power Behind the Throne: Information Integration in the Age of Data-Driven Discovery"" highlights the role of database and data integration techniques in the growing field of data science. Jignesh Patel's talk, ""From Data to Insights @ Bare Metal Speed,"" explains how hardware and software need to be co-evolved to support the needs of scalable data analytics. Jennifer Widom, winner of the 2015 ACM-W Athena Lecturer Award for fundamental contributions to computer science, will give her award talk, ""Three Favorite Results,"" on Tuesday. Christopher Ré will lead a panel on ""Machine Learning and Databases: The Sound of Things to Come or a Cacophony of Hype?,"" with participants Divyakant Agrawal, Magdalena Balazinska, Michael Cafarella, Michael Jordan, Tim Kraska, and Raghu Ramakrishnan. Of course, there are also 106 research paper presentations, 4 tutorials, 30 demonstrations, and 18 industrial papers. Papers will be presented both as talks during the research sessions, and as part of plenary Poster Sessions.SIGMOD 2015 is preceded by the PhD Workshop, as well as workshops on leading-edge topics like data analytics (DanaC), databases and the Web (WebDB), exploratory search (ExploreDB), managing and mining spatial data (GeoRich), and graph data (GRADES); the New Researcher Symposium will take place on Wednesday. The banquet will be held in a Melbourne landmark, the Town Hall.As in recent years, we had two submission deadlines for SIGMOD this year, one in August and one in November. The review process was journal-style, with multiple rounds of reviews coordinated by the Group Leaders. We accepted 34 of 137 papers from the first deadline and 72 of 278 from the second deadline. The total acceptance rate was about 25.5%, and we believe that the revision processhas improved the quality of the technical program.",2015,8/19/2020 6:59,8/19/2020 6:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is an annual public holiday that commemorates the coronation in 1253 of Mindaugas as the first and only King of Lithuania. The conference venue is the Parliament buildings (Seimas) of the Republic of Lithuania, and the conference dinner is to served in the reconstructed Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, one of the most famous in Europe in the 15–17th centuries. ITiCSE 2015 is hosted by Vilnius University, one of the oldest and most famous establishments of higher education in Eastern and Central Europe, founded in 1579. The conference organizers represent the Lithuanian research group of Informatics and Informatics Engineering Didactics at the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics of Vilnius University.This conference brings together delegates from all over the world to address pressing issues in computing education. In addition to invited lectures, papers, panels, posters, and tips, techniques & courseware sessions, the conference provides facilities and exposure for working groups and exhibitions.The conference continues to be truly international with a total of 170 submissions from 40 countries on six continents, with authors from Africa (4), Asia (50), Europe (151), North America (119), Oceania (51), and South America (17). These submissions consisted of 124 research papers, 1 panel, 9 working group proposals, and 36 proposals for posters or for tips, techniques & courseware.All research papers were double blind reviewed by at least four reviewers, though most papers received five or six reviews. A meta-review was conducted by the members of the conference committee to ensure the reliability of the reviews and to make recommendations to the chairs. A final selection phase was conducted by the program chairs who reviewed all reviews and meta-review recommendations before making their final decisions. As a result of this process, 54 research papers (43.5%) were selected for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings. The authors of the accepted papers come from 17 different countries on five continents.All poster submissions were blind reviewed by two members of the conference committee, and tips, techniques & courseware submissions were blind reviewed by three members of the conference committee. Submissions in these categories were then reviewed by the conference chair before selection by the program chairs for final inclusion in the conference. Twenty-four were accepted, representing authors from 15 countries.The two keynote speakers address the learning of programming and computational thinking. Professor Mordechai (Moti) Ben-Ari from the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, will give a talk titled In Defense of Programming, which defends the (perhaps controversial) position that programming is the fundamental activity of CS. In the other keynote talk Professor Maciej M. Syslo from Nicolaus Copernicus University and University of Wroc\law, Poland, will address algorithmic nand computational thinking as the way to computing for all students.ITiCSE is famous for its working groups. Participating in a working group provides a unique opportunity to work with people from different countries who are interested and knowledgeable in the area of the working group. It is also one of the best ways to become part of the ITiCSE community. Seven working groups have been accepted over a broad spectrum of topics. The working groups range from general topics, such as computing education terminology, CS education in K-9 and K-12 schools, and designing an IT curriculum framework for graduates in 2025, to more specific topics such as developing a repository for high school CS questions, visual assessment tools and metadata annotations, and how students construct solutions to programming problems. The leaders of the accepted working groups come from over 13 countries.Welcome to Vilnius and enjoy the vicennial ITiCSE conference and Lithuania's Statehood Day!",2015,8/19/2020 6:59,8/19/2020 6:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data acquisition and monitoring tasks are vital functions that must be developed at every stage of the grid for a proper operation. This paper presents a remote monitoring platform (RMP) to monitor an experimental SMG. It integrates Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) (solar and wind) and hydrogen to operate in isolated regime. The RMP has been developed using the open-source authoring tool Easy Java/Javascript Simulations (EJsS). The interface has been designed to be intuitive and easy-to-use, providing real-time information of all the involved magnitudes over the network. Scalability, easy development, portability and cost effective are the main features of the proposed framework. The microgrid and the proposed monitoring platform are described and the successful results are reported. The remote user executes a ready-to-use file with low computational requirements and is enabled to graphically and numerically track the SMG behaviour. These results prove the suitability of the RMP as an effective means for continuous visualization of the coordinated energy flows of a real SMG.",2017,8/19/2020 6:59,8/19/2020 6:59,,489–505,,,148,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Renewable energy sources; Smart grid; Easy Java/Javascript Simulations; Hydrogen; Remote monitoring; Smart microgrid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One area of particular interest is transport and mobility, where data is important for urban planning and smart city-related activities, but can also be used to provide individual users with feedback and suggestions for personal behavior change. As part of a large-scale study based in Switzerland, we use activity tracking data to provide people with eco-feedback on their own mobility patterns and stimulate them to adopt more energy-efficient mobility choices. In this paper we explore the opportunities offered by smartphone based activity tracking, propose a general framework to exploit location data to foster more sustainable mobility behavior, describe the technical solutions chosen and discuss a range of outcomes in terms of user perception and sustainability potential. The presented approach extracts mobility patterns from users' trajectories, computes credible alternative transport options, and presents the results in a concise and clear way.

However, this analysis is usually limited to the analysis of single days. Since the smart metering data are time series formed by sequential measurements of energy through each hour or quarter of hour of the day, and also through each day, thanks to the implementation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and the Smart Grid technologies, it becomes clear that the analysis of the data needs to be extended to consider the dynamic evolution of the consumption patterns through days, weeks, months, seasons, and even years. This is the objective of the present work. A new framework is presented that addresses the dynamic clustering, visualization and identification of temporal patterns in load profiles time series, fulfilling the detected gap in this area. The present development is a generic framework that allows the clustering and visualization of load profiles time series applying different classical clustering algorithms. A novel dynamic clustering algorithm is also presented, based on an initial segmentation of the energy consumption time series data in smaller surfaces, and the computation of a similarity measure among them applying the Hausdorff distance.

To address this problem, this paper proposes a visual analytical approach, called HybridVis, creating an interactive layout to reveal clusters of obvious characteristics on one or more attributes at different scales. HybridVis can help people gain social insight and better understand the roles of attributes within a cluster. First, an approximate optimal graph hierarchy based on an energy model is created, considering both data attributes and relationships among data items. Then a layout algorithm and a level-dependent perceptual view for multi-scale graphs are proposed to show the attribute-driven graph hierarchy. Several views, which interact with each other, are designed in HybridVis, including a graphical view of the relationships among clusters; a cluster tree revealing the cluster scales and the details of attributes on parallel coordinates augmented with histograms and interactions. From the meaningful and globally approximate optimal abstraction, users can navigate a large multivariate graph with an overview+detail to explore and rapidly find the potential correlations between the graph structure and the attributes of data items.

Based on the data obtained from either predictions or measurements, different strategies are combined and tested to reduce the energy demand, whilst keeping the indoor comfort at suitable level. Although the information expressed from data representation can significantly influence the decisions, little research has focused on extracting features from building measurements. This paper provides an in-depth view into representation of building data, and applies three dimensionality reduction algorithms Principle Component Analysis (PCA), autoencoder and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) on measurements from a teaching building. Results show that whilst PCA returns linear representations, it also has the least data compression, which can be useful for obtaining more general features.

However, t-SNE may be unsuitable for datasets with recurring step-like temporal profiles.

Building operations and energy management professionals have long used this simple 1–100 score to understand how their building compares to its peers. This single number is easy to use but is created by potentially inaccurate multiple linear regression (MLR) models and lacks much further information about why a building achieves that score. This paper proposes a methodology that enhances the existing Energy Star calculation method by increasing accuracy and providing additional model output processing to help explain why a building is achieving a particular score. Two new prediction models were proposed and tested: multiple linear regression with feature interactions (MLRi) and gradient boosted trees (GBT). Both models performed better than a baseline Energy Star MLR model as well as four baseline models from previous benchmarking studies. This paper shows that for six building types, on average, the third-order MLRi models achieved a 4.9% increase in adjusted R2 and a 7.0% decrease in normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) over the baseline MLR model. More substantially, the most accurate GBT models, on average, achieved a 24.9% increase in adjusted R2 and a 13.7% decrease in NMRSE against the baseline MLR model. In addition, a set of techniques was developed to help determine which factors most influence a building's energy use versus its peers using SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values. The SHAP force visualization, in particular, offered an accessible overview of the aspects of the building that influenced the score that even non-technical users can interpret. This methodology was tested on the 2012 Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS)(1,812 buildings) and public data sets from the energy disclosure programs of New York City (11,131 buildings) and Seattle (2,073 buildings).",2020,8/19/2020 6:59,8/19/2020 6:59,,115413,,,276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Building energy benchmarking; Building performance rating; Feature interaction; Gradient boosting trees; Interpretable machine learning; Multiple linear regression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such systems have the potential to enable buildings to meet energy management goals of reducing total energy consumption and cost.

However, the use of physics-based models in the analytics offers potential improvements by providing an accurate estimation of outputs based on representation of the physical principles governing the building system behaviors. This also permits the use of design stage models to inform commissioning and operation. This paper describes the development and testing of a hybrid data-driven and physics model-based operational tool for energy efficiency in central cooling plants. The tool offers FDD functionality, setpoint optimization, and visualization of key performance parameters. It was demonstrated at a university campus in the mixed-humid ASHRAE Climate Zone 4A. Key performance metrics that were analyzed include plant electricity use reduction, plant model calibration, and system economics. Annual simulations indicate the tool can provide electricity savings of greater than 10% for approximately six months of the year, mainly during the winter season when wet bulb temperatures are low, though only 1.38% savings for the entire year. Additionally, over a 4-day period in April, recommended optimal setpoints were implemented, resulting in 17% savings versus metered baseline consumption. With respect to model calibration, the difference between model-predicted and measured parameters was less than 10% for 90% of data points acquired for three of six chillers, and for each ten cooling towers.

However, a quantitative model representing passive release mechanism of such terrestrial filamentous fungi is still critically lacking. In this study, a combined experimental and mathematical modeling approach has been applied to characterize the dynamic response of passive release of spores upon exposure to air. The spore flux was observed to decrease with time when exposed to constant air velocity. The flux also displayed a cyclic behavior in response to velocity cycles. Based on the visual observations of the test surface that the conidiophore bend during air flow, the behavior of the fungal spores is explained in terms of the velocity gradient and the corresponding drag force acting on the conidiophores. The decrease in the observed spore flux with time was strongly correlated with the visual observations of the bending of the fungal conidiophore during airflow. These observations clearly suggest that the velocity and the drag on the spore corresponding to a bent conidiophore are smaller than that of a vertical conidiophore and consequently results in a smaller spore flux from a bent conidiophore. Based on the developed model, an important parameter, representing the energy required to aerosolize spores from the conidiophores was also determined (5.58 μJ for Penicillium chrysogenum).

From pediatrics to geriatrics, disruption of the blood supply to the femoral neck is a well-recognized source of morbidity and mortality, oftentimes resulting in avascular necrosis of the femoral head. This devastating complication occurs in 10–45% of femoral neck fractures. Therefore, it is vital for orthopedic surgeons provide efficient treatment of this injury, in order to optimize the patient's potential outcome and prevent long-term sequelae. Methods In this study, the anatomy of the proximal femur, including femoral metaphysis, femoral neck, vasculature, and femoral head, were simulated in COMSOL Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software. Electric fields were generated in a fashion that exploited disruptions within the vasculature of the femoral neck. This study was aimed at developing an alternative imaging modality for narrowing or disrupting the femoral neck's vasculature. The variables used for investigation included: frequency, penetration depth, and magnitude of the electrical energy. These variables, when combined, allowed for enhanced simulated visualization of the vasculature of the femoral neck and theoretically expedited diagnosis of obvious, or occult, femoral neck injury. Results Simulated blood vessels were developed in two-dimensions: the phi direction (circular), and z-direction. Two different frequencies, 3 GHz, and 5 GHz were considered, with 100-J energy pulses within blood vessels of 2.54 mm in diameter. The fat surrounding the bone to the outside surface body was simulated at 0.25 inch (0.65 cm). An additional model, with layered fat and skin above the vessels, was simulated at 2000J and successfully able to visualize the femoral neck's blood vessels.

However, after long-term operation in a complex environment, various faults may occur in the VRF systems, resulting in failure to meet users comfort requirements and even unnecessary increase in energy consumption. This paper proposes a simulated annealing wrapped generic ensemble fault diagnosis strategy for typical faults of VRF systems, such as refrigerant charge amount (RCA) faults, valve faults, and compressor liquid return (LF) faults. The simulated annealing algorithm based on random forest (SA-RF) is first utilized to perform feature selection process on the three kinds of fault datasets to select the optimal variables that can well characterize the fault states, which can improve the modeling efficiency while reducing the data dimensionality. Then five component learners and the proposed ensemble model based on them are established adopting the optimal variables as input variables. Through visualizing the error evolution and margin of the boosting models built in the first stage of the integration process, it was found that the boosting models can effectively avoid overfitting and most samples are correctly classified with high confidence. By comparing with the five component learners, it is concluded that the boosting strategy in the first stage can improve the diagnostic performance of the models, and the weighted voting integration strategy in the second stage can further improve the diagnostic performance of the model. The final ensemble model can effectively compensate for the deficiencies of each component learners and its diagnostic accuracy for the three fault data sets is as high as 95.37%, 99.36% and 98.3%, respectively, indicating that the model can be applied to diagnose the three types of faults in VRF system at the same time, showing a high versatility.",2020,8/19/2020 6:59,8/19/2020 6:59,,110281,,,224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ensemble learning; Fault diagnosis; Liquid floodback; Refrigerant; Simulated annealing algorithm; Valves; VRF system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The folding energy landscape of an RNA is highly dependent on its nucleotide sequence and molecular environment. Cellular molecules sometimes alter the energy landscape, thereby changing the ensemble of likely low-energy conformations. The effects of these energy landscape changes on the conformational ensemble are particularly challenging to visualize for large RNAs. We have created a robust approach for visualizing the conformational ensemble of RNAs that is well suited for in vitro versus in vivo comparisons. Our method creates a stable map of conformational space for a given RNA sequence. We first identify single point mutations in the RNA that maximally sample suboptimal conformational space based on the ensemble's partition function. Then, we cluster these diverse ensembles to identify the most diverse partition functions for Boltzmann stochastic sampling. By using, to our knowledge, a novel nestedness distance metric, we iteratively add mutant suboptimal ensembles to converge on a stable 2D map of conformational space. We then compute the selective 2′ hydroxyl acylation by primer extension (SHAPE)-directed ensemble for the RNA folding under different conditions, and we project these ensembles on the map to visualize. To validate our approach, we established a conformational map of the Vibrio vulnificus add adenine riboswitch that reveals five classes of structures.

We also collected the whole-transcript in vitro and in vivo SHAPE-MaP for human β-actin messenger RNA that revealed similar global folds in both conditions.

For visualizing, interpreting, and analyzing data a GIS can be used. This chapter mainly focuses on the application of GISs in energy generation from waste treatment processes like incineration, pyrolysis, gasification, etc. A GIS serves as an optimal decision support system for converting waste to energy (WTE) by incorporating various input spatial data sets. WTE is a promising alternative for solid waste management and it is a potential source for the production of renewable energy. GISs help in finding suitable locations for WTE conversion plants and also maintain the database for capacity, energy production, and subsequent distribution of energy from the plant.

A lot of research effort has been devoted to construct the conceptual framework, identify the important elements and evaluate the effectiveness of SPSS. However, there is still no SPSS development approach from user-centric perspective. Therefore, this article aims to provide a novel understanding of user-centric SPSS (UC-SPSS), outline the conceptual framework of UC-SPSS and contribute a UC-SPSS development approach. Specifically, a multimodal user analysis module with S-E-T (society-economy-technology) analysis, user behavioral analysis and user segmentation is deployed. According to the user needs identified, a provider identification and integration network is established in the dimensions of material, data and value flows. Jointly considering the user needs and provider capability, the BCE (benefit-cost-expectation) model and Product Function Architecture are applied to assist in the realization of the smart, connected service. To illustrate, a UC-SPSS on medication management for the elderly was developed, and it has been evaluated from user experience and sustainable value aspects. The results showed that the developed medication service is interesting and helpful for the elderly to take their medication. However, the service is not simple enough, especially in data visualization. In terms of sustainable value, the developed service can achieve better performance in economic, material and energy costs, and can support the further regulation of medical industry.

There is thus a need to develop new tools to understand the energy consumption patterns across cities. Statistical methods are often used to understand the driving parameters of energy consumption but rarely used to evaluate future urban refurbishment scenarios. Simulating whole cities using energy demand softwares can be very extensive in terms of computer resources and data collection. A new methodology, using city archetypes, is hence proposed to simulate the energy consumption of urban areas and to evaluate urban energy planning scenarios. The objective of this paper is to present a solid framework and innovative solution for the computation and visualization of energy saving at the city scale. The energy demand of cities, as well as the microclimatic conditions, are calculated by using a 3D model designed as function of the real city urban geometrical and physical characteristics. Data are extracted from a GIS database. We demonstrate how the number of buildings to be simulated can be drastically reduced thereby significantly decreasing the computational time and without compromising the accuracy of the results. This model is then used to evaluate the influence of two sets of refurbishment solutions. The energy consumption are then integrated back in the GIS to identify the areas in the city where refurbishment works are needed more rapidly. The city of Settimo Torinese (Italy) is used as a demonstrator for the proposed methodology, which can be applied to medium-sized cities worldwide with limited amount of information.",2019,8/19/2020 6:59,8/19/2020 6:59,,19–36,,,88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Built environment; Deterministic models; Geographical information system; Spatial decision support system; Statistical models; Urban heat energy planning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies show that a new type of cyber-attack called False Data Injection (FDI) attack can bypass bad data detection mechanisms in the power system state estimation. Existing countermeasures might not be able to manage topology changes and integration of distributed generations because they are designed for a specific system configuration. To address this issue, an unsupervised method to distinguish between attack and normal patterns is proposed in this paper. This method can detect FDI attacks even after topology changes and integration of renewable energy sources. In this method, we assume that injecting false data into the power systems will lead to a deviation in the probability distribution of the state vector from the normal trend. The main phases of the proposed algorithm are: (1) Normalizing the dataset, (2) Adding several statistical measures as the new features to the dataset to quantify the probability distribution of the state vectors, (3) Employing principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, (4) Visualizing the reduced data for humans and exploiting their creativity to detect attacks, and (5) Locating the attacks using Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm. The proposed method is tested on both the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 9-bus systems using real load data from the New York independent system operator with the following attack scenarios: (1) attacks without any topology change, (2) attacks after a contingency, and (3) attacks after integration of distributed generations. Experimental results show that our proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art classification algorithms in dealing with changes. In addition, the reduced data which is helpful in distinguishing between attack and normal patterns can be fed into an expert system for further improvement of the security of the power grid.",2017,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,242–261,,,84,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Visualization; Smart grid; Unsupervised learning; Cyber-attacks; Distributed generation; False data injection; State estimation; Topology changes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The developed low-cost SCADA operates on a microgrid that incorporates a photovoltaic array, a wind turbine, a biomass gasification plant and a battery bank as an energy storage system. Sensors and power meters for electrical parameters, such as voltage, current, frequency, power factor, power generation, and energy consumption, were processed digitally and integrated into Arduino-based devices.

On the other side, advances on 3D modelling, visualization and interaction technologies enable user profiling and represent part of the holistic approach which aims at integrating renewable energy solutions in the existing building stock. To unlock the potentiality of these technologies, the case study selected for this research focuses on interoperability between Building Information Models (BIM), GIS (Geographic Information System) models and Energy Analysis Models (EAM) for designing Renewable Energy Strategies (RES) among the demonstrator. The objectives aim at making a whole series of data concerning the energy efficiency and reduction at district level usable for various stakeholders, by creating a District Information Model (DIM). The described system also integrates BIM and district level 3D models with real-time data from sensors to analyse and correlate buildings utilization and provide real-time energy-related behaviours. An important role is played by the energy simulation through the EAM for matching measured and simulated data and to assess the energy performance of buildings starting from a BIM model or shared data. With this purpose interoperability tests are carried out between the BIM models and quasi-steady energy analysis tools in order to optimize the calculation of the energy demand according to the Italian technical specification UNI TS 11300. Information about the roofs slope and their orientation from the GIS model are used to predict the use of renewable energy – solar thermal and PV – within the selected buildings (both public and private) of the demonstrator in Turin, Italy. The expected results are a consistent reduction in both energy consumption and CO2 emissions by enabling a more efficient energy distribution policies, according to the real characteristics of district buildings as well as a more efficient utilization and maintenance of the energy distribution network, based on social behaviour and users attitudes and demand.

Can the technologies we have to hand, and their increasing ubiquity, assist people to better understand the forces leading to landscape change, comprehend the science of landscape, take a more informed view on proposals, and adapt to some inevitable outcomes?

Various techniques are used to complete the data of one of the series; the wavelet transform is used as the control method, and its scalogram is used to visualize it. If the representation in the scalogram has zero magnitude, it shows the absence of data, so that if the data are properly filled in, then they have similar magnitudes to the rest of the series. The proposed method has shown that in case of data series inconsistencies, the wavelet transform can identify the lack of accuracy of the natural periodicity of these data. This result can be visually checked using the WT's scalogram. Additionally, the scalograms provide valuable information on the variables studied, e.g. periods of higher wind speed. In summary, the wavelet transform has proven to be an excellent analysis tool that reveals the seasonal pattern of wind speed in periodograms at various scales.",2019,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,552–561,,,185,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Renewable energy; Data filling; FFT; Missing data; Wavelet transform; Wind data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since GRB was launched in 1997, it has been operated as a data warehouse to collect and store research information from research institutes. To increase the discoverability and accessibility of the research information in GRB, the website services of GRB have been improved recently by applying visualization tools and text-mining tools. The new GRB provides multi-dimensional search engine for users to search for research projects, researchers and institutes. Users can explore the search results through not only the related record list, but also the word cloud graphs derived from text-mining results of those related contents. Word cloud graphs can help users to form concepts in mind about what researches have been done recently. The new GRB also applies an API provided by Lucene to calculate the similarity between every two projects, and to provide the list of similar projects ranking by their similarity to the main project interested by users. Users can also easily find a group of researchers working on similar topics and their cooperation network graphs by typing in a researcher's name or just a keyword in the researcher search engine. Furthermore, to help users locate the institutes which are conducting projects on a specific topic, geographic visualization tool is applied to display the location of those institutions. Besides the improvement of search engine, a data-oriented charting tool called Highcharts is also applied to display the real-time calculated results of the data collected by GRB. Users can interact with the charts online to explore the number of projects and the amount of research budgets that government has already input every year since 1993. To further serve users interested in some specific hot topics (such as biotech medicine, green energy, and artificial intelligent), the new GRB also provides analysis reports and value-added analyses using GRB data to reveal the research trends about those hot topics.

While the alloy processing conditions and chemistry determine the microstructure according to the phase diagram, the microstructure determines the behavior when exposed to corrosive environments. An automated data-centric high-throughput framework using density functional theory (DFT) based first-principles approach was developed to rank intermetallic chemistry and texture for their vulnerability in corrosive environments. As a test case, a user-interactive database for Mg-X-Y composition was created and made publicly available. The high-throughput framework was subsequently used to screen Mg-RE and Mg-Al-RE (RE = La, Ce, Nd) alloy precipitates from the database for corrosion resistance. The surface energies for different symmetrically distinct crystallographic orientations and work functions for the stable phases were calculated using an automated and intelligent workflow without requiring manual intervention. The predictions were compared against previous experimental and theoretical results, calculated properties and corrosion rates. The data was analyzed to provide guidance and insights on microstructure design with a focus on corrosion and creep resistant alloys. While the heat of formation seems to be a reliable material descriptor for the thermal stability of the phases for better creep resistance, the minimum surface energy is a reliable descriptor for the most stable crystallographic surfaces critical for corrosion resistance. These correlations established using a consistent first-principles based theory, which are computationally inexpensive, can simplify the exploration of possible elemental makeup and microstructural design and guide the design of corrosion and creep resistant alloys.",2020,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,109541,,,175,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Alloy database; First-principles; High-throughput; Surface energy; Work function,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the field of building operation, building performance simulation (BPS) can help in quantifying unmeasured energy flows, for instance solar gains, heat loss from infiltration, etc. Furthermore, integrating building information modeling (BIM) in building operation and maintenance can decrease operation risk and costs, as well as maintain facility management quality. However, in practice there is a lack of efficient utilization of this application by building operators. The aim of this paper is to provide an integrated framework to estimate and visualize energy flows and the associated cost. The framework consists of 1) developing a BIM model, 2) converting the BIM model to a BPS model, 3) calibrating the model, and 4) visualizing energy and cost flows using Sankey diagrams.

Such systems are capable of monitoring epileptic seizures reliably, which are classified as chronic diseases. Three challenging issues raised in this context with regard to the transformation, compression, storage, and visualization of big data, which results from a continuous recording of epileptic seizures using mobile devices. Methods In this paper, we address the above challenges by developing three new algorithms to process and analyze big electroencephalography data in a rigorous and efficient manner. The first algorithm is responsible for transforming the standard European Data Format (EDF) into the standard JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and compressing the transformed JSON data to decrease the size and time through the transfer process and to increase the network transfer rate. The second algorithm focuses on collecting and storing the compressed files generated by the transformation and compression algorithm. The collection process is performed with respect to the on-the-fly technique after decompressing files. The third algorithm provides relevant real-time interaction with signal data by prospective users. It particularly features the following capabilities: visualization of single or multiple signal channels on a smartphone device and query data segments. Results We tested and evaluated the effectiveness of our approach through a software architecture model implementing a mobile health system to monitor epileptic seizures. The experimental findings from 45 experiments are promising and efficiently satisfy the approach's objectives in a price of linearity. Moreover, the size of compressed JSON files and transfer times are reduced by 10% and 20%, respectively, while the average total time is remarkably reduced by 67% through all performed experiments. Conclusions Our approach successfully develops efficient algorithms in terms of processing time, memory usage, and energy consumption while maintaining a high scalability of the proposed solution. Our approach efficiently supports data partitioning and parallelism relying on the MapReduce platform, which can help in monitoring and automatic detection of epileptic seizures.",2017,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,79–94,,,149,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Big data; EEG; Epileptic seizure; Mapreduce; Mobile monitoring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these data is generally not detailed enough, being available at different scales and in different formats. The integrated use of these data is critical to validate different methods to predict and model energy consumption in cities, as well in addressing its energy saving potential.

The objective is to improve accessibility of these data to all stakeholders, including building operators, planners, occupants, and utilities. The methods are then applied to a 45-building Canadian university campus and an array of graphical representations of the data is provided.

The major contribution of this paper is providing an objective assessment and a quantitative data analytic interpretation from the pattern recognition literature for the reported findings. The experimental study adopted one of the traditional stone structures of medieval Cairo. The house was monitored during summer days for Indoor and outdoor temperatures. Further data for local climate were obtained and given to TRNSYS 17 in which simulations were generated and validated against measured data. The absolute deviance error between simulated and measured indoor temperatures was 0.3°C for a couple of monitored spaces. Data visualization and regression analysis of indoor temperature on two values of outdoor temperature show a relative stability of the indoor temperature, a direct result of the heat storage capacity of the stone walls. A quantitative interpretation of the regression equation tells that the indoor temperature increases by merely 1°C if the outdoor temperature increased by 11.5°C. Upon ambient-temperature-responsive natural ventilation, the maximum indoor temperatures were reduced, in average of 5.5°C and 4.2°C below ambient for two different spaces. A comparative analysis took place then between the base case and a modified model were the walls' material was substituted with hollow red bricks. For the two rooms, the energy demand for cooling was found to be as less as 72% and 56% in the base case than the brick-walls model.",2017,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,68–76,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,data analysis; Energy efficiency; Indoor temperature; Pattern recognition; Thermal mass; Thermal simulations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the area of building energy efficiency, closely coupled with this effort is the prevalence of building energy benchmarking policies, which require public disclosure of vast new quantities of building-level energy data at urban scales (i.e., open urban energy data). While existing research efforts have focused on the potential of this data to transform energy efficiency markets and investments in the real estate sector, little research has been dedicated to assessing this information's value to the general public. Given that achieving energy reductions in the built environment will require not only energy efficiency investments, but also greater awareness, engagement, and action from ordinary citizens, we study the potential of open urban energy data in providing citizen benefits. Energy-cyber-physical systems offer a pertinent framework to link data from the virtual world to citizens' physical reality in order to improve their understanding and decision making. Adopting an energy-cyber-physical system perspective, we aim to connect open urban energy data to citizens through the development and evaluation of a novel community-scale energy feedback system. This mobile cyber-physical system transforms building-level electricity consumption and production data across Georgia Tech's campus into a mobile application consisting of three features: spatial feedback, energy supply feedback, and energy consumption feedback. Augmented-reality visualization elements are integrated into the system, providing Georgia Tech community members a direct link between their experienced physical environment and data stored in the virtual world. Applying a user-centered design approach, prospective users evaluate the system via thinking aloud sessions and user surveys to assess understandings and perceptions of open urban energy data for the Georgia Tech campus. The results contribute to literature seeking to create energy feedback systems at the community-scale and expand research investigating citizen reactions to and opinions of open urban energy data.

There are many types of energy use behaviors in residential buildings with strong randomicity and complex driving forces. A set of reasonable stochastic energy use behaviors simulation method with improved operability and prediction accuracy is required for the stochastic energy use behaviors. Therefore, a description method for residential energy use behaviors is proposed based on the theory of human dynamics. The residential energy use behaviors are divided into persistent behaviors and transient ones according to the method. The characteristics and regularity of these behaviors are described from the inherent decision-making mechanisms, which lays a theoretical foundation for modelling residential stochastic energy use behaviors in residential buildings. Consequently, a simulation model and algorithm for stochastic energy use behaviors are established based on “subject and event mechanism”. The model focuses on the entire generation process from occupants' movement to energy use behaviors. The occupants' movement sequences and persistent event sorting units are generated according to the BARABASI priority queue model and the highest priority decision. Also, based on the various control logic, the occurrence of transient behaviors is predicted. Finally, a household is selected for the annual measurement of stochastic energy use behaviors. Based on the above simulation method, MATLAB and NETLOGO are utilized with algorithm programming to realize the dynamic simulation of stochastic energy use behaviors in this household. The accuracy of the model is verified after comparing with the measured data.

This study aimed to evaluate this concept in reverse. Hence to investigate if increased attenuation within the liver allows for improved visualization of little or not-enhancing lesions. Methods A 3D-printed phantom mimicking the shape of a human liver exhibiting a lesion in its center was designed and printed. Both, parenchyma- and lesion-mimic were filled with different solutions exhibiting 80/100/120HU and 0/15/40/60HU, respectively. Further, a total of 74 contrast-enhanced studies performed on a spectral detector CT scanner (SDCT) were included in this retrospective study. Patients had MRI or follow-up proven cysts and/or hypodense metastases. VMI of 40–200 keV as well as conventional images (CI) were reconstructed. ROI were placed in lesion and parenchyma(-mimics) on CI and transferred to VMI. Signal- and contrast-to-noise ratio were calculated (S-/CNR). Further, two radiologists independently evaluated image quality. Data was statistically assessed using ANOVA or Wilcoxon-test. Results In phantoms, S/CNR was significantly higher in VMI_low. The cyst-mimic in highly attenuating parenchyma-mimic on CI yielded a CNR of 6.4 ± 0.8; using VMI_40 keV, mildly hypodense lesion-mimic in poorly attenuating parenchyma-mimic exhibited a similar CNR (5.8 ± 0.9; p ≤ 0.05). The same tendency was observed in patients (cyst in CI/metastasis in VMI_40 keV: 4.4 ± 1.2/3.9 ± 1.8; p ≤ 0.05). Qualitative analysis indicated a benefit of VMI_40 keV (p ≤ 0.05).

This study proposes a participatory stakeholder analysis process that includes a two-dimensional power-interest matrix and fuzzy logic to define and classify relevant stakeholder groups. The proposed framework was implemented to recognize the relevant stakeholder groups of the Icelandic energy system and assess their salience. The defined stakeholder groups were then evaluated based on two attributes—power and interest—using data collected from a web-based questionnaire. Considering the wide range of the attributes' values for the many stakeholder groups, fuzzy logic was applied to plot a 3D decision surface, which provided a more accurate assessment of stakeholders' salience. The generated power-interest map visualizes the dynamic influential level of stakeholder groups when it comes to decision-making concerning sustainable energy development. The fuzzy decision surface shows a more accurate image of the difference in the degree of power and interest and saliences of the stakeholder group. Results reveal that Decision-makers, Industrial Users, Professional Interest groups, and Energy Producers have the highest salience and are the most influential stakeholder groups concerning decision-making.

This duty however requires a continuous extension of their operating range, provoking the emergence of complex flow patterns featuring cavitation inside the turbine runner and the draft tube. When the power output is maximized at full load, self-excited pressure oscillations in the hydraulic system may occur, which translate into significant electrical power swings and thus pose a serious threat to the grid stability as well as to the operational safety of the machine. Today's understanding of the underlying fluid–structure interaction mechanisms is incomplete, yet crucial to the development of reliable numerical flow models for stability analysis, and for the design of potential countermeasures. This study therefore reveals how the unsteady flow inside the machine forces periodic mechanical loads onto the runner shaft. For this purpose, the two-phase flow field at the runner exit is investigated by Laser Doppler Velocimetry and high-speed visualizations, which are then compared to the simultaneously measured wall pressure oscillations in the draft tube cone and the mechanical torque on the runner shaft. The results are presented in the form of a comprehensive, mean phase averaged evolution of the relevant hydro-mechanical data over one period of the instability. They show that the flow in the runner, and thus the resulting torque applied to the shaft, is critically altered by a cyclic growth, shedding and complete collapse of cavitation on the suction side of the runner blades. This is accompanied by a significant flow swirl variation in the draft tube cone, governing the characteristic breathing motion of the cavitation vortex rope.",2017,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,56–71,,,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cavitation; Francis turbines; Full load; Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV); Pressure surge; Self-oscillation; Swirling flows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Renewable energy's popularity has grown because it is environmentally friendly and abundant in natural environments. Despite its enormous potential as a viable alternative to traditional (fossil fuel-based) energy sources, renewable energy has rarely been commercialized and utilized. Its lack of commercialization has something to do with a lack of evidence proving its eco- and cost-efficiency. With this in mind, this paper aims to assess the eco- and cost-efficiency of renewable energy such as algae-based biofuels using data visualization. It also intends to help increase public awareness and facilitate the commercialization of renewable energy such as biofuels. Through experiments, this paper found that the success of biofuel commercialization hinged on temperature, light intensity, and algae strain. Another important finding is that the low carbon footprint resulting from biofuel consumption may not directly contribute to the immediate revenue growth of a biofuel producing company, but it can foster a long-term positive image that will help attract more customers in the future with increased brand recognition. Furthermore, this paper evaluates the effectiveness, the level of user involvement, and the usability of two data visualization tools built upon the dashboard and the balanced scorecard.

However, there have been no fully automated algorithms to visualize the data collected with this technique. In such context, the current paper presents a method for a full automation of GPR data visualization and analysis. Based on the background removal, depth correction, synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT), and interpolation algorithms, this automated method produces a plan view map of amplitude of GPR signals. In the obtained map, two types of information are observed at the same time. First, as the strongest reflectors of electromagnetic energy, rebars will appear as the most visible. Second, the areas of corrosive environment and, thus, likely corrosion, will be detected as having low amplitude rebar reflections. As a proof of concept, the proposed method was implemented for two bare concrete bridge decks and two concrete bridge decks with asphalt overlays. In all cases, the results obtained were excellent where the maps pinpointed the areas affected by corrosion. These areas were confirmed by other methods of evaluation, such as electrical resistivity (ER), half-cell potential (HCP), chloride analysis of core samples, or visual inspection. With the demonstrated performance, the proposed method is expected to be an excellent alternative to the available methods of GPR data evaluation and visualization.

To perform large computation and storage, a DC is equipped with more than thousands of servers or even more. Due to a large number of these computational devices put in use at DC, produces a large amount of heat. Therefore the cost to maintain the thermal balance in a DC has increased significantly and has become almost equal to the cost of operating these systems. The main problem in heat management is ‘Hot spots creation' which can cause hardware inefficiencies, and operational disruptions and in turn have a negative impact on overall functionality. To address these issues this paper aims at decreasing energy consumption of DC by allowing administrators, designers, and planners to model, visualize and analyze the thermal status of various configurations and solutions. A major difficulty in the thermal analysis of DC is the lack of simulation tool, where the impact of design (layout) and workload on thermal status can be tested. Therefore there is a need for a simulator that approaches the problem from an end-user perspective and takes into account all the factors that are critical to analyzing thermal balance in DC. A simulator is developed that takes DC computational devices as input and provide models that allow designers to analyze and visualize DC thermal conditions. The simulator allows the user to apply different job allocation strategies and can analyze thermal status for each; that help them choose the best strategy for job allocation. It enables DC administrator to organize servers and racks before their actual implementation. Moreover, servers can be relocated to analyze and maintain thermal balance. The user will also able to predict thermal condition after a specific time period. The simulator enables a DC user/administrator to maintain thermal balance in DC by detecting the root cause of hot spots under different workload; which will help them make better workload balancing decisions.",2018,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,324–340,,,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Visualization; Data center; Modeling; Prediction; Simulator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, only high-level aggregated data at the sectoral and regional levels exists in the literature. Through bottom-up energy demand tree development, we identified end-use processes for each mining operation in these sectors. The energy intensities for each end-user were calculated and used in a bottom-up energy-environmental model to determine the associated end-use process GHG emissions. The results were then used to develop Sankey diagrams that allow us to visualize the energy and GHG emissions flows from resource to end use by energy use sector, fuel type, and various jurisdictions in Canada. The overall energy and GHG emission intensities for iron, gold, and potash mining are 0.7, 149.8, 1.8 GJ/Mg and 33, 4922, 158 kg CO2 eq./Mg, respectively. Firing, ventilation, and product drying and steam generation end-use devices had the highest energy use share of 42%, 20%, and 47% in iron, gold, and potash mining sectors, respectively, in 2016. Firing in iron mining, ore transport in gold mining, and product drying and steam generation in potash mining were responsible for 66%, 22%, and 34% of the respective total sectoral GHG emissions. 56% of the GHG emissions were from Saskatchewan, followed by Quebec (18%), and Newfoundland and Labrador (14%).

The two major “neurotransmitter hypotheses” of obesity state that increased food intake is partially driven by decreased dopamine-mediated reward and decreased serotonin-mediated homeostatic feedback in response to food intake. Using molecular neuroimaging studies to visualize and quantify aspects of the central dopamine and serotonin systems in vivo, recent PET and SPECT studies have also implicated alterations in these systems in human obesity. The interpretation of these data, however, is more complex than it may appear. Here, we discuss important characteristics and limitations of current radiotracer methods and use this framework to comprehensively review the available human data on central dopamine and serotonin in obesity.

Unrepaired DSBs are thought to be one origin of micronuclei (MN), an indicator of genotoxic stress and chromosomal instability. Studies have detected γH2AX in IR-induced MN, indicating the presence of DSB in MN. Previously we reported that TGFβ downstream proteins Smad7 and phospho-Smad2 (pSmad2) co-localized with DDR proteins following radiation. Here we studied the status of Smad7 and pSmad2 in MN post high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation in human normal and cancerous cells. We observed γH2AX foci in IR-induced MN, whereas 53BP1 and ATF2 were absent. Interestingly, Smad7 foci, but not pSmad2, were detectable in both spontaneous and IR-induced MN. We compared the effect of particle track structures on the yield of MN using 5.6MeV/u boron (B) and 600MeV/u iron (Fe) particles with similar LET (200 and 180keV/μm, respectively) in human fibroblasts. The frequency of MN induced by B was lower than that by Fe particles, albeit the proportion of Smad7-positive to Smad7-negative MN remained constant. An increased frequency of spontaneous MN, with slightly higher ratio of Smad7 or γH2AX positive, was found in human prostate cancer cells (PC3) compared to normal cells. 24h after 1Gy of Fe particles exposure, the yield of MN increased, and the majority (∼70%) carried γH2AX and Smad7. Phospho-ATM (Ser1981) foci were found in both spontaneous and IR-induced MN in PC3 cells, displaying a much lower frequency compared to γH2AX and Smad7.

The objective evaluation of appetite remains difficult, very often restricted to indirect measurements of food intake and body weight. We report here, the direct, non‐invasive visualization of hypothalamic activation by fasting using diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging, in the mouse brain as well as in a preliminary study in the human brain. The brain of fed or fasted mice or humans were imaged at 7 or 1.5Tesla, respectively, by diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging using a complete range of b values (10<b<2000s.mm−2). The diffusion weighted image data sets were registered and analyzed pixel by pixel using a biexponential model of diffusion, or a model-free Linear Discriminant Analysis approach. Biexponential fittings revealed statistically significant increases in the slow diffusion parameters of the model, consistent with a neurocellular swelling response in the fasted hypothalamus. Increased resolution approaches allowed the detection of increases in the diffusion parameters within the Arcuate Nucleus, Ventromedial Nucleus and Dorsomedial Nucleus. Independently, Linear Discriminant Analysis was able to classify successfully the diffusion data sets from mice and humans between fed and fasted states. Present results are consistent with increased glutamatergic neurotransmission during orexigenic firing, a process resulting in increased ionic accumulation and concomitant osmotic neurocellular swelling. This swelling response is spatially extendable through surrounding astrocytic networks until it becomes MRI detectable.

While vehicle-based atmospheric detection of gas leakage would be convenient for a distributed operation such as Weyburn, implementing atmospheric detection schemes, particularly those that target CO2, are challenging in that natural ecosystems and other human activities both emit CO2 and will contribute to regular false positives.

It is of paramount importance, therefore, to capture the origins and derivation of the published data in order to achieve high levels of scientific reproducibility, transparency, internal and external data reuse and dissemination. The consequence of the modern research paradigm is that high performance computing and data management systems, together with metadata cataloguing, have become crucial elements within the nuclear fusion scientific data lifecycle. This paper describes an approach to the task of automatically gathering and cataloguing provenance metadata, currently under development and testing at Culham Center for Fusion Energy. The approach is being applied to a machine-agnostic code that calculates the axisymmetric equilibrium force balance in tokamaks, EFIT++, as a proof of principle test. The proposed approach avoids any code instrumentation or modification. It is based on the observation and monitoring of input preparation, workflow and code execution, system calls, log file data collection and interaction with the version control system. Pre-processing, post-processing, and data export and storage are monitored during the code runtime. Input data signals are captured using a data distribution platform called IDAM. The final objective of the catalogue is to create a complete description of the modeling activity, including user comments, and the relationship between data output, the main experimental database and the execution environment.

In this context and to facilitate targeted resource and energy policy measures, profound knowledge of the status quo of biomass utilization is of crucial importance. The core objective of this paper is to provide complete flow diagrams of the biomass streams within the Austrian economic system from a meso-scale perspective, taking into account all types of uses. Contrary to material flow accounts (MFA), internal streams (e.g. due to biomass processing and transformation, recycling and reuse of residues and by-products, stock changes of end-consumer products) are explicitly taken into consideration and quantified. This approach reveals gaps and inconsistencies in statistical data and facilitates conclusions about quantities not recorded in statistics. Furthermore, the structure of biomass use is visualized and the extent of biogenic material reuse and recycling is revealed. The results show that biomass imports to Austria surpassed exports by about 15% in 2011 (based on dry mass). The distribution of biomass among the different uses depends on whether direct consumption or final uses are considered. In the latter case, which is considered more appropriate, inland biomass consumption was distributed as follows: 7% human food, 18% raw material, 38% energy and 37% animal feed. Exports are primarily composed of wood products. Contrary to common assumption, energy recovery is still usually the ultimate step of cascadic biomass use rather than primary purpose, or based on by-products. Judging from wood quantities being processed and consumed and foreign trade data, domestic wood supply according to felling reports (and stated as “domestic extraction used” in official MFA data) is clearly underrated. Conversely, domestic feed production according to MFA data is inconsistent with official animal feed statistics and appears to be overestimated by at least 30%.",2015,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,100–111,,,95,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sankey diagram; Austria; Bioenergy; Biomass; Material flows; MFA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In pulses of about 50 femtoseconds duration they provide as many photons as one gets in 1 s from modern storage ring synchrotron radiation facilities. FLASH, the Free-Electron Laser at DESY in Hamburg was the first FEL in the XUV/soft X-ray spectral range, started operation as a user facility in summer 2005, and was for almost 5 years the only short wavelength FEL facility worldwide. Hence, most of the technological developments as well as the scientific experiments performed by the user community were new and unique as outlined below. FLASH was driving FEL science and technology and paved the way for many new ideas. Because of using a linear accelerator in superconducting RF technology FLASH combines the extreme peak brightness characteristic for FELs with very high average brightness. It also was the prototype for the European XFEL located in the Hamburg metropolitan area, which started user operation in summer 2017. The present review provides an overview of the progress made with accelerator science and technology at FLASH for the production of stable beams of well characterized electron pulses, reduction of the pulse jitter to the femtosecond level, generation of ultra-short photon pulses, adequate synchronization of the machine parameters with the experiment, and demonstrating advanced FEL schemes using variable gap undulators. Much of this was done in the very exciting early days of FEL science when it was even not clear if the FEL concept could be realized for X-rays. The development and the operation of the FLASH user facility is described, as well as the techniques developed to make use of the new type of X-ray beams including photon beam diagnostics and damage studies of the optical elements. The review emphasizes breakthrough experiments which demonstrated that many of the ideas collected in the world-wide discussion of the scientific case of free-electron lasers could indeed be realized and they often produced unexpected results. The first experiment on Coulomb explosion of Xe clusters performed in 2002 was a clear demonstration of the feasibility of experiments with free-electron laser beams and opened a lively discussion in the atom, molecular and optical physics community (AMO). Time resolved single-shot single-particle imaging, summarized in the slogan “Take movies instead of pictures”, was one of the most popular science drivers for the construction of free-electron X-ray lasers. As a first step in this direction experiments using a highly focused beam of FLASH demonstrated that pictures of 2 dimensional objects could be reconstructed from single-shot single-particle diffraction patterns. Explosion dynamics of nano-size particles hit by an intense FEL pulse were studied. This method, called “diffraction before destruction”, is now very successfully applied with hard X-rays and, to a large extent, solves the radiation damage problem in structural biology. A long term goal is to determine the 3 dimensional structure of a large molecule from a single-shot diffraction pattern. Along these lines the 3D architecture of free Ag nanoparticles could be determined from one diffraction pattern only using soft X-rays from FLASH. To understand light–matter interactions in this new parameter space a number of pioneering AMO experiments have been performed including non-linear interactions in atoms, molecules and clusters. Multiphoton photoionization processes in the presence of intense optical fields have been studied, as well as photo-absorption of XUV photon energies on molecular ions important for astrophysics. The nature of formation and breaking of molecular bonds was investigated in VUV pump–VUV probe experiments using a reaction microscope and a specific delay line. As an example the process of ultrafast isomerization of acetylene molecules C2H2 triggered by single photon excitation has been studied. The structural changes during the isomerization process were visualized and an isomerization time of 52 +/- 15 fs was found. Clusters of variable size, which can be produced routinely, allow distinguish between inter- and intra-atomic effects and are considered model systems for the investigation of light–matter interactions in multi-atom objects. As an example such experimental studies provided instructive data for benchmarking theoretical models describing cluster ionization in intense short-wavelength laser pulses. The combination of single-shot single-particle imaging for determination of the cluster size with spectroscopy was crucial for success of these experiments. The investigations could later be extended to very large Xe clusters providing new insights into the nanoplasma formation and explosion dynamics of such large systems From early on, studies of high energy density plasmas and warm dense matter have been one of the most prominent research fields in building the scientific case for X-ray free-electron lasers. A good understanding of this complex regime between cold solids and hot dilute plasmas is important for high pressure studies, applied materials studies, inertial fusion, and planetary interiors. With the first observation of saturable absorption of an L-shell transition in Aluminum and pioneering studies of warm dense hydrogen FLASH kicked off research of matter in extreme conditions with free-electron lasers. In condensed matter experiments the emphasis is not so much on the peak power of the FEL beam and extreme focusing, but on beam properties like polarization and pulse duration. The sample has to stay intact in the beam over hours and the number of photons per pulse impinging on the sample has to be limited to avoid space charge effects. After demonstrating the possibility to record single-shot resonant magnetic scattering images with FELs the first time-resolved demagnetization study using a pump–probe approach with an IR-pump pulse and an XUV probe pulse to record a resonant magnetic scattering pattern as a function of pump–probe delay was also performed at FLASH. Free-electron lasers offer the possibility to extend the well-established X-ray spectroscopic techniques for the investigation of the static electronic structure of matter to probing the evolution of the electronic structure in the time domain after controlled excitation. At FLASH first time resolved core level photoemission (TR-XPS) experiments have been performed which are element specific and provide information on the dynamics of the local charge state around a specific center. Using 198 eV photons in a surface study at Ir single crystals it was possible to separate surface and bulk contributions in the Ir 4f levels with sufficient instrumental resolution. Time and angular resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (TR-ARPES) is a very powerful tool to study non-equilibrium electron dynamics of condensed matter systems, since it offers the possibility to follow the dynamics of the full band structure of a material. In another pioneering experiment the photo-induced dynamics of the Mott insulator 1T-TaS2 was studied at FLASH by investigating the dynamics of the Ta 4f photoemission. The formation of a commensurate charge density wave (CCDW) leads to a splitting of the Ta 4f level which decreases first on a sub-picosecond time scale due to electronic melting of the CCDW and afterwards on a picosecond lifetime due to electron–phonon coupling. This leads to transfer of energy from the electronic system to the lattice and a partial melting of the periodic lattice distortions accompanying the periodic charge arrangement in the CCDW phase. In materials science X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy are among the most powerful spectroscopies to study the electronic structure of matter. The wavelength of the radiation is scanned over certain element specific resonances which at FLASH 1 can only be done by scanning the electron energy. This is time consuming and makes the experiments difficult. Nevertheless, the first time-resolved X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) experiment was done at FLASH 1 in order to study non-thermal melting of a silicon sample. From a comparison of the observed valence electronic structure at different times after the photoexcitation it became clear that in the melting process in the first few ps a non-equilibrium low density liquid state is reached. The existence of such a metastable low density liquid state had been postulated for many systems that show tetragonal bonding in the crystalline phase like water for example, but spectroscopically the time-resolved silicon XES data taken at FLASH verified its existence for the first time. FLASH 2 has tunable undulators and it was demonstrated that scanning of the wavelength is very easy there.",2019,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,1–74,,,808,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>10 years of pioneering X-ray science at the Free-Electron Laser FLASH at DESY</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agonism of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) within the central nervous system activates BAT in mice. Moreover, in patients with type 2 diabetes, GLP-1R agonism lowers body weight and improves glucose and lipid levels, possibly involving BAT activation. Interestingly, people from South Asian descent are prone to develop cardiometabolic disease. We studied the effect of GLP-1R agonism on BAT in humans, specifically in South Asians and Europids without obesity or type 2 diabetes. Methods Twelve Dutch South Asian and 12 age- and BMI-matched Europid nondiabetic men received 12 weeks extended-release exenatide (Bydureon) in this single-arm prospective study. Before and after treatment, BAT was visualized by a cold-induced [18F]FDG-PET/CT scan and a thermoneutral MRI scan, and resting energy expenditure (REE), substrate oxidation, body composition and fasting plasma glucose and serum lipids were determined. Appetite was rated using a visual analogue scale. Results Since the effect of exenatide on metabolic parameters did not evidently differ between ethnicities, data of all participants were pooled. Exenatide decreased body weight (−1.5 ± 0.4 kg, p < 0.01), without affecting REE or substrate oxidation, and transiently decreased appetite ratings during the first weeks. Exenatide also lowered triglycerides (−15%, p < 0.05) and total cholesterol (−5%, p < 0.05), and tended to lower glucose levels. Notably, exenatide increased BAT metabolic volume (+28%, p < 0.05) and mean standardized uptake value (+11%, p < 0.05) ([18F]FDG-PET/CT), without affecting supraclavicular adipose tissue fat fraction (MRI).

The material structure where radiation propagates is assumed to consist of homogeneous bodies limited by quadric surfaces. The pengeom subroutines (a subset of the penelope code) track particles through the material structure, independently of the details of the physics models adopted to describe the interactions. Although these subroutines are designed for detailed simulations of photon and electron transport, where all individual interactions are simulated sequentially, they can also be used in mixed (class II) schemes for simulating the transport of high-energy charged particles, where the effect of soft interactions is described by the random-hinge method. The definition of the geometry and the details of the tracking algorithm are tailored to optimize simulation speed. The use of fuzzy quadric surfaces minimizes the impact of round-off errors. The provided software includes a Java graphical user interface for editing and debugging the geometry definition file and for visualizing the material structure. Images of the structure are generated by using the tracking subroutines and, hence, they describe the geometry actually passed to the simulation code.

Computer: PC with Java Runtime Environment installed. Operating system: Windows, Linux. RAM: 210 MiB Classification: 21.1, 14. Nature of problem: The Fortran subroutines perform all geometry operations in Monte Carlo simulations of radiation transport with arbitrary interaction models. They track particles through material systems consisting of homogeneous bodies limited by quadric surfaces. Particles are moved in steps (free flights) of a given length, which is dictated by the simulation program, and are halted when they cross an interface between media of different compositions or when they enter selected bodies. Solution method: The pengeom subroutines are tailored to optimize simulation speed and accuracy. Fast tracking is accomplished by the use of quadric surfaces, which facilitate the calculation of ray intersections, and of modules (connected volumes limited by quadric surfaces) organized in a hierarchical structure. Optimal accuracy is obtained by considering fuzzy surfaces, with the aid of a simple algorithm that keeps control of multiple intersections of a ray and a surface. The Java GUI PenGeomJar provides a geometry toolbox; it allows building and debugging the geometry definition file, as well as visualizing the resulting geometry in two and three dimensions. Restrictions: By default pengeom can handle systems with up to 5000 bodies and 10,000 surfaces. These numbers can be increased by editing the Fortran source file. Unusual features: All geometrical operations are performed internally. The connection between the steering main program and the tracking routines is through a Fortran module, which contains the state variables of the transported particle, and the input-output arguments of the subroutine step. Rendering of two- and three-dimensional images is performed by using the pengeom subroutines, so that displayed images correspond to the definitions passed to the simulation program. Additional comments: Java editor and viewer (PenGeomJar), geometry examples, translator to POV-Ray™ format, detailed manual. The Fortran subroutine package pengeom is part of the penelope code system [1]. Running time: The running time much depends on the complexity of the material system. The most complicated example provided, phantom, an anthropomorphic phantom, has 264 surfaces and 169 bodies and modules, with different levels of grouping; the largest module contains 51 daughters. The rendering of a 3D image of phantom with 1680x1050 pixels takes about 25 s (i.e., about 1.5⋅10−5 seconds per ray) on an Intel Core I7-3520M CPU, with Windows 7 and subroutines compiled with gfortran.

In the procedure to restore distribution networks, power interruption damages must be minimized by energizing the largest possible number of customer loads in the shortest time interval. The restoration problem of distribution networks can be mathematically formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem that is non-convex of type NP-complete. The existence of heating loads causes the cold load pickup condition in the distribution network that requires the step-by-step procedure increasing the complexity of the restoration problem. In this work, therefore, it is proposed a methodology to solve the restoration problem of large-scale distribution networks with heating loads where the mathematical model is subjected to intentional islanding of distributed generation and voltage control through optimized adjustments on capacitor banks and voltage regulators.

In the present study a simple colorimetric sensor should be developed and tested for the real-time detection of Cyt c in living cells. We synthesized cadmium telluride quantum dots (CdTe QDs) capped with thioglycolic acid (TGA) as a fluorometric Cyt c nanosensor. The synthesized TGA/CdTe QDs nanosensor was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and absorption as well as fluorescence spectrophotometry. We investigated the developed TGA/CdTe QDs sensor with regard to its applicability in the fluorometric detection of Cyt c. Results showed that the TGA/CdTe QDs could be used as a sensitive fluorescence probe for the quantification of different concentrations of Cyt c ranging from 0.5 − 2.5μM. Increased binding of QDs to Cyt c results in decreasing fluorescence. The fluorescence of the QDs is inversely correlated to the Cyt c concentration. Based on these data, a standard curve up to 2.5μM Cyt c was established. Moreover, the developed nanosensor was applied in different concentrations on primary human dermal fibroblasts. Results showed that TGA/CdTe QDs were taken up by cells and could be visualized by fluorescence microscopy.

Most previous works used Western blot analysis to detect the phosphorylation on the Tyr416 residue, which activates c-Src kinase. Methods Here we compared the results of c-Src tyrosine phosphorylation via aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent mechanisms from Western blot analysis with fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay detecting c-Src activation after treatment with TCDD to activate AhR in two different human cell types. Results Western blot analyses show time-dependent phosphorylation of c-Src by TCDD in HepG2 and MCF-10A cells. Data from FRET assay visualized and quantified the activation of c-Src kinase induced by TCDD in living cells of both cell types. The FRET efficiency decreased by 20%, 5min after TCDD treatment and continued decreasing until the end of the experiment, 25min after TCDD treatment. PP2, a c-Src specific inhibitor, suppressed both TCDD- and epidermal growth factor- (EGF) induced c-Src activation. In contrast, the AhR antagonist 3′-methoxy-4′nitroflavone (MNF) blocked only TCDD- but not EGF-induced activation of c-Src. Conclusions The current study shows that the early activation of c-Src via EGF and AhR signaling pathways can be visualized in living cells using the FRET assay which is in line with Western blot analysis.

However, separate visualization of these three AD-related pathologies in living humans has not been conducted. Here, we show that positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using the three radiotracers (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB), 2-(1-6-[(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthylethylidene) malononitrile (FDDNP), and 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG), in the same subjects, with and without AD, can provide valuable information on the pathological patterns of the distribution of tracers for amyloid plaque, neurofibrillary tangle, and glucose hypometabolism in AD. Voxel-based analysis of PIB-PET in patients with AD compared with normal control subjects showed that patients with AD have highly significant PIB retention in brain regions known to have high amyloid plaque deposition (e.g., frontal, parietal, temporal, and posterior cingulate/precuneus cortices). In contrast, voxel-based analysis of FDDNP-PET showed significantly high FDDNP binding in some brain regions known to have high tangle accumulation in patients with AD compared with age-matched normal subjects (e.g., entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal gyrus, and secondary visual cortex). In addition, because FDDNP binds both plaques and tangles but PIB binds plaques specifically, we examined subtracted PET data (FDDNP minus PIB) acquired from the same patients with AD using an SPM analysis. We found that the hippocampal formation was the most significant brain region in the voxel mapping of FDDNP minus PIB in the same patients with AD. Voxel-based analysis of FDG-PET in the same subjects revealed that brain regions with glucose hypometabolism in patients with AD overlap with regions of high PIB binding. In conclusion, PET imaging using these three radiotracers in the same subjects may contribute toward developing and testing disease-modifying drugs targeting amyloid pathology, tau pathology, and/or energy metabolism.",2010,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,488–496,,2,52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Alzheimer; Amyloid; Metabolism; Neuropathology; Positron emission tomography; Tau,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Present-day wearables are typically battery-powered, and their limited lifetime has become the critical issue. Most devices need recharging every few days or even hours, falling short of the expectations for a truly satisfactory user experience. This paper presents the design, implementation and in-field evaluation of InfiniTime, a novel sensor-rich smart bracelet powered by energy harvesting. It is designed to achieve self-sustainability using solar cells with only modest indoor light levels and thermoelectric generators (TEG's) with small temperature gradients from the body heat. The wearable device is equipped with an ultra-low power camera and a microphone, in addition to accelerometer and temperature sensors commonly used in commercial devices. Experimental characterization of the fully operational prototype demonstrates a wide range of energy optimization techniques used to achieve self-sustainability with harvested energy only. Our experiments in real-world scenarios show an average of up to 550μW for photovoltaic in indoor and 98μW for TEG with only 3° temperature gradient and up to 250μW for 5° gradient. Simulations using energy intake measurements from solar and TEG modules confirm that InfiniTime achieves self-sustainability with indoor lighting levels and body heat for several realistic applications featuring data acquisition from the on-board camera and multiple sensors, as well as visualization and wireless connectivity.

Computer: Any, but the code is mainly designed for multicore architectures. Operating system: Linux. RAM: Depends on the size of the discretized biomolecular system. Classification: 3. Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEGB_v1_1 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 184 (2013) 2618 External routines: Users are allowed to use external routines/libraries (e.g., MSMS [6] and TMSMesh [4]) to generate compatible surface mesh input data if they choose not to use the embedded automatic mesh generation tool in the package. Post-processing tools such as VCMM [5] and VMD [3] can also be used for visualization and analyzing results. The package uses two subprograms: (1) The iterative Krylov subspace solver, SPARSKIT, from Yousef Saad [2]; and (2) Cilk-based parallel fast multipole methods from FMMSuite [1]. Does the new version supersede the previous version? Yes Nature of problem: Numerical solution of the linearized Poisson–Boltzmann equation that describes electrostatic interactions of molecular systems in ionic solutions. Solution method: The linearized Poisson–Boltzmann equation is reformulated as a boundary integral equation and is subsequently discretized using the node-patch scheme. The resulting linear system is solved using Krylov subspace solvers iteratively. The reformulation of the equation provides an upper bound for the number of iterations. Within each iteration, the matrix–vector multiplication is accelerated using the adaptive plane-wave expansion based fast multipole methods. The majority of the codes are parallelized using the Cilk runtime. Reasons for new version: New functions are added and a few old functions like force calculations are removed. The algorithm is parallelized and most parts of the code are rewritten. Summary of revisions: The computation is parallelized and an automatic mesh generation method for BEM is added. Restrictions: The program has only been tested on machines running Linux operating system. Additional comments: The Cilk runtime used in the development and testing is from the Intel compiler Suite. The GNU Cilk Plus and Cilk Plus/LLVM branches have not been tested. Running time: The running time depends on the number of discretized elements (N) and their distribution. It also depends on the number of cores used in the computation. References: [1] http://www.fastmultipole.org/. [2] http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/$\sim$saad/software/.

Our dual energy coronary calcium (DECC) processing method included automatic heart silhouette segmentation, sliding organ registration and scatter removal to create a bone-image-like, coronary calcium image with significant reduction in motion artifacts and improved calcium conspicuity compared to standard, clinically available DE processing. Experiments with a physical dynamic cardiac phantom showed that DECC processing reduced 73% of misregistration error caused by cardiac motion over a wide range of heart rates and x-ray radiation exposures. Using the functional measurement test (FMT), we determined significant image quality improvement in clinical images with DECC processing (p < 0.0001), where DECC images were chosen best in 94% of human readings. Comparing DECC images to registered and projected CT calcium images, we found good correspondence between the size and location of calcification signals.

Due to climate induced solar resource variations, achieving high reliability levels necessitates excess generation and storage capacity which can significantly increase the end consumer cost of energy. Due to severe financial limitations, many consumers in the developing world may prefer cost versus reliability trade-offs, as long as their basic energy needs are met. Defining reliability as the percent of electricity demand a grid can deliver, we utilize a time series energy balance algorithm at hourly resolution to create cost versus reliability curves of micro-grid performance. We then propose a micro-grid sizing strategy which enables designers with knowledge of local energy needs to determine the acceptability of potential micro-grids. Our strategy relies on visualizing simulation data at increasing levels of temporal resolution to determine where energy shortfalls occur and if they interfere with high priority energy demand.

This is of particular interest for the integration of advanced mobility assets, where path planning, balanced energy provision and consumption as well as communication coverage grow in importance with the excursion distance. The existing modeling and simulation tools for the lunar surface environment have therefore been revisited and extended to incorporate aspects of mobile exploration. An extended analysis of the lunar topographic models from past and ongoing lunar orbital missions has resulted in the creation of a tool to calculate and visualize slope angles in selected lunar regions. This allows for the identification of traversable terrain with respect to the mobile system capabilities. In a next step, it is combined with the analysis of the solar illumination conditions throughout this terrain to inform system energy budgets in terms of electrical power availability and thermal control requirements. The combination of the traversability analysis together with a time distributed energy budget assessment then allows for a path planning and optimization for long range lunar surface mobility assets, including manned excursions as well as un-crewed relocation activities. The above mentioned tools are used for a conceptual analysis of the international lunar reference architecture, developed in the frame of the International Architecture Working Group (IAWG) of the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG). Its systems capabilities are evaluated together with the planned surface exploration range and paths in order to analyze feasibility of the architecture and to identify potential areas of optimization with respect to time-based and location-based integration of activities.",2012,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,15–24,,,75,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Modeling; Human exploration; ISECG; Lunar surface environment; Mobility; Moon; Terrain analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Painless Laser Epidermal System) and to determine the effect of pore number and depth on the rate and extent of drug delivery across the skin. In addition, the micropores were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy and histological studies were used to determine the effect of laser fluence (energy applied per unit area) on pore depth. Porcine ear skin was used as the membrane for both the pore characterization and drug transport studies. Confocal images in the XY-plane revealed that the pores were typically 150–200μm in diameter. Histological sections confirmed that fluence could be used to effectively control pore depth — low energy application (4.53 and 13.59J/cm2) resulted in selective removal of the stratum corneum (20–30μm), intermediate energies (e.g., 22.65J/cm2) produced pores that penetrated the viable epidermis (60–100μm) and higher application energies created pores that reached the dermis (>150–200μm). The effects of pore number and pore depth on molecular transport were quantified by comparing lidocaine delivery kinetics across intact and porated skin samples. After 24h, cumulative skin permeation of lidocaine with 0 (control), 150, 300, 450 and 900 pores was 107±46, 774±110, 1400±344, 1653±437 and 1811±642µg/cm2, respectively; there was no statistically significant difference between 300, 450 and 900 pore data — probably due to the effect of drug depletion since >50% of the applied dose was delivered. Importantly, increasing fluence did not produce a statistically significant increase in lidocaine permeation; after 24h, cumulative lidocaine permeation was 1180±448, 1350±445, 1240±483 and 1653±436µg/cm2 at fluences of 22.65, 45.3, 90.6 and 135.9J/cm2, respectively. Thus, shallow pores were equally effective in delivering lidocaine. Increasing lidocaine concentration in the formulation from 10 to 25mg/ml produced a corresponding increase in permeation (at 24h, 1650±437 and 4005±1389µg/cm2, respectively). The validity of the porcine skin model was confirmed as transport across porcine and human skins was shown to be statistically equivalent (at 24h, 1811±642 and 2663±208µg/cm2, respectively). The clinical potential of the technology and its capacity to provide significantly faster delivery than conventional passive administration was demonstrated in short duration experiments involving application of a marketed lidocaine cream (LMX4®) to laser-porated skin; after only 5min of formulation application, lidocaine deposition was measured at 61.3±7.5µg/cm2.

Big data usually comes from the Internet, enterprise systems, Internet of Things, and other information systems. Data collection and preparation, storage management, data processing, data analysis, and knowledge presentation would generate new insights to support decision-making and business intelligent operation. Smart grid is a developing trend of electrical power energy industry. The core message is to implement the next generation of cyber-physical systems shaping future energy industry that is based on a deep merge of operational technology and internet information technology. The growth of smart grid is dependent on the availability of high performance computing (HPC) and analytics technology to process a massive amount of data set. Deployment of advanced technologies within smart grid and usage of state-of-the-art computing systems provide utility companies with innovative capabilities. These advances lead to unprecedented explosion of data volumes. As smart grid operations will leverage advanced metering infrastructure to drive more real time decision-making and operational activities, complex event processing and stream computing are needed for the modern smart grid. The chapter discusses one core technique that would support the growth of smart grid, big data with HPC, with a focus on the platform, data integration, warehousing, and analytics that are particularly adaptive to handle a variety of characteristics of energy industry data. Finally, the chapter summarizes and proposes a comprehensive, technical solution for smart grid platform with applications focusing on complementary operation of multiform energy system that supports all aspects within a data lifetime cycle, e.g., acquisition, storage, analytics, and visualization.",2018,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,57–73,,,,,,,,,,,Elsevier,,,,,,,,,DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-811968-6.00004-8,,,,Microgrid; MapReduce; Smart grid; BaaS; Complex event processing; Lambda architecture; Microservice architecture; Spark; Complementary operation of multiform energy syste,,"Arghandeh, Reza; Zhou, Yuxun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design Eight sound third molars had the occlusal enamel removed by cutting with a diamond disk and five cylindrical cavities (±2mm diameter; ±1.5mm depth) were prepared over the dentin surface in each specimen (n=40 cavities). After sterilization, each specimen received the bacterial salivary inoculum obtained from individuals without any systemic diseases presenting dentin caries lesions and were incubated in BHI added of with 5% sucrose for 96h to allow biofilm formation. After that, two consecutive micro-CT scans were acquired from each specimen (40kv and 70kv). Reconstruction of the images was performed using standardized parameters. After alignment, registration, filtering and image calculations, a final stack of images containing the biofilm volume was obtained from each prepared cavity. Dentin demineralization degree was quantified by comparison with sound dentin areas. All data were analyzed using Shapiro-Wilk test and Spearman correlation using α=5%.

Although some uncertainty information has been available in the ENDF/B libraries since the 1970ʼs, this content has been fairly limited in scope, the quality quite variable, and the use of covariance data confined to only a few application areas. Today, covariance data are more widely and extensively utilized than ever before in neutron dosimetry, in advanced fission reactor design studies, in nuclear criticality safety assessments, in national security applications, and even in certain fusion energy applications. The main problem that now faces the ENDF/B evaluator community is that of providing covariances that are adequate both in quantity and quality to meet the requirements of contemporary nuclear data users in a timely manner. In broad terms, the approach pursued during the past several years has been to purge any legacy covariance information contained in ENDF/B-VI.8 that was judged to be subpar, to include in ENDF/B-VII.0 (released in 2006) only those covariance data deemed then to be of reasonable quality for contemporary applications, and to subsequently devote as much effort as the available time and resources allowed to producing additional covariance data of suitable scope and quality for inclusion in ENDF/B-VII.1. Considerable attention has also been devoted during the five years since the release of ENDF/B-VII.0 to examining and improving the methods used to produce covariance data from thermal energies up to the highest energies addressed in the ENDF/B library, to processing these data in a robust fashion so that they can be utilized readily in contemporary nuclear applications, and to developing convenient covariance data visualization capabilities. Other papers included in this issue discuss in considerable detail various aspects of the data producer communityʼs efforts to improve the evaluation methods and to add covariance content to the ENDF/B library. The present paper offers just a brief glimpse of these activities by drawing material from covariance papers presented at meetings, workshops and international conferences during the past five years. Highlighted are: advances in methods for producing and processing covariance data, recently developed covariance visualization capabilities, and the development and implementation of quality assurance (QA) requirements that should be satisfied for covariance data to be included in ENDF/B-VII.1.",2011,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,3037–3053,,12,112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>Special Issue on ENDF/B-VII.1 Library</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) is designed to evaluate diffusion movements of the molecules on a spatial axis. These incoherent microscopic molecular movements cause loss of phase of the protons and reduce signal intensity. Diffusion may be evaluated on a different spatial axis at different time/space scales, depending on the direction, timing, and strength of the applied magnetic field gradients. Signal may simply be converted into an image or may be further elaborated to obtain a quantitative map of the ADC. A region of restricted diffusion on a given spatial axis will appear hyperintense on the DWI and hypointense on the ADC maps. Diffusion in the tissues depends on capillary flow and on the intracellular movements requiring active metabolism. In addition proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (PMRS) provides useful information, complementing that gained through MRI, with regard to cell membrane proliferation, neuronal damage, energy metabolism, and necrotic transformation of brain or tumor tissues. One needs to be able to interpret both images and the spectroscopy data accurately to derive information about the location, edema, mass effect, calcification, cyst formation, visualization, and contrast enhancement, given the patient's age and clinical presentation.",2010,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,249–503,,,,,,,,,,,Elsevier,London,,,,,,,,DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-384711-9.00003-8,,,,,,"Kaila, Madan; Kaila, Rakhi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, toxicogenomics is considered as a fruitful area for searching cellular pathways and mechanisms including cancer, immunological diseases, environmental responses, gene-gene interactions and chemical toxicity. In this work, we examined toxic effects of Tungsten Borides NPs on gene expression profiling of the human lung alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiC). In line with this purpose, a single crystal of tungsten boride (mixture of WB and W2B) nanoparticles was synthesized by means of zone melting method, and characterized via using X-ray crystallography (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) techniques. Cell viability and cytotoxicity were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), neutral red (NR) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release tests. The whole genome microarray expression analysis was performed to find out the effects of WB and W2B NPs mixture on gene expression of the HPAEpiC cell culture. 123 of 40,000 gene probes were assigned to characterize expression profile for WB/W2B NPs exposure. According to results; 70 genes were up-regulated and 53 genes were down-regulated (≥2 fold change). For further investigations, these genes were functionally classified by using DAVID (The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) with gene ontology (GO) analysis. In the light of the data gained from this study, it could be concluded that the mixture of WB/W2B NPs can affect cytokine/chemokine metabolism, angiogenesis and prevent migration/invasion by activating various genes.",2017,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,257–265,,,273,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Human lung alveolar epithelial cells; Microarray analysis; Toxicogenomics; Tungsten boride nanoparticles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the dosimeter is calibrated with standard X-rays, it is unclear whether this dosimeter can be used in various clinical situations in which radiation exposure is not only caused by direct X-rays but also scattered X-rays. In this paper, in order to evaluate the applicability of an OSL dosimeter, we propose a novel method to derive a proper calibration factor using X-ray spectrum and the efficiency of the dosimeter. The X-ray spectra were calculated by means of a Monte-Carlo simulation code taking into consideration the effects of beam hardening, scattered X-rays and backscattering X-rays. As a result of analysis of calibration factors, we found that the difference of calibration factors from the standard, which was determined with 80 kV X-rays, was within 30%. Here, we focused our attention on dose measurement of medical staff who held a patient during pediatric X-ray examination; in this examination, a calibration factor can be determined precisely. In order to determine the dosimetric points, we mimicked a clinical situation using a neonate phantom and human dummies, and surface dose distributions to the human dummies were visualized. Based on the phantom study, we determined that the dosimetric positions of both hands and neck of the assistant during the actual clinical measurement were most important. Then, actual dosimetry in a clinical situation was performed. The OSL dosimeters were attached to the neck and hands of assistants during a pediatric X-ray examination, and doses were evaluated individually for each examination (N = 163). By analyzing data trends, we found that the dose to the assistant's hands was relatively higher when a younger patient was examined. In contrast, the dose to the neck position was the same regardless of the patient's age. In conclusion, we performed accurate dosimetry taking into consideration differences of X-ray spectra being incident to the dosimeter, and using our method, we can analyze individual doses to assistants for each pediatric X-ray examination.",2018,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,209–219,,,119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Actual dose measurement; Medical dosimetry; OSL dosimeter; Pediatric X-ray examination; Penetrating X-rays; Scattered X-rays,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The focus of CityGML is on the semantical aspects of 3D city models, its structures, taxonomies and aggregations, allowing users to employ virtual 3D city models for advanced analysis and visualization tasks in a variety of application domains such as urban planning, indoor/outdoor pedestrian navigation, environmental simulations, cultural heritage, or facility management. This is in contrast to purely geometrical/graphical models such as KML, VRML, or X3D, which do not provide sufficient semantics. CityGML is based on the Geography Markup Language (GML), which provides a standardized geometry model. Due to this model and its well-defined semantics and structures, CityGML facilitates interoperable data exchange in the context of geo web services and spatial data infrastructures. Since its standardization in 2008, CityGML has become used on a worldwide scale: tools from notable companies in the geospatial field provide CityGML interfaces. Many applications and projects use this standard. CityGML is also having a strong impact on science: numerous approaches use CityGML, particularly its semantics, for disaster management, emergency responses, or energy-related applications as well as for visualizations, or they contribute to CityGML, improving its consistency and validity, or use CityGML, particularly its different Levels-of-Detail, as a source or target for generalizations. This paper gives an overview of CityGML, its underlying concepts, its Levels-of-Detail, how to extend it, its applications, its likely future development, and the role it plays in scientific research. Furthermore, its relationship to other standards from the fields of computer graphics and computer-aided architectural design and to the prospective INSPIRE model are discussed, as well as the impact CityGML has and is having on the software industry, on applications of 3D city models, and on science generally.",2012,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,12–33,,,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Standards; GIS; City; Interoperability; Three-dimensional; Urban,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the central concern of this article is to identify the simultaneous consequences of viscous dissipation and Ohmic heating on the flow of an electrically conducting Williamson fluid generated by stretching/shrinking sheet. Flow is subject to a time-dependent magnetic field which is applied in transverse direction. The dimensionless variables are used to transform the governing equations including mass, momentum and energy conservation into ordinary differential equations. The reduced equations subject to the given boundary conditions have been solved by employing Runge-Kuta Fehlberg method followed by shooting technique. In addition, the multiple solutions for dimensionless fluid velocity and temperature distributions are captured when certain amount of mass suction is employed through the porous shrinking surface. The dynamic thermo-physical dimensionless parameters controlling the flow and heat transfer features are the magnetic parameter, viscosity ratio parameter, Weissenberg number, suction parameter, Eckert number and Prandtl number. It is visualized from multiple branches that the skin friction enhances with magnetic parameter for the upper branch solution and it reduces for lower branch solution. On the other side, obtained numerical results illustrated that the rate of heat transfer shows an accelerating trend with higher unsteadiness parameter for both the solutions. The obtained results show a better agreement of this model with respect to experimental data, compared to the homogeneous model.",2018,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,933–940,,,126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Magnetohydrodynamic; Multiple solutions; Ohmic heating; Stretching/shrinking sheet; Viscous dissipation; Williamson fluid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ESP usually works with the presence of two-phase liquid-liquid flows that constitute dispersions and emulsions, causing performance losses and operational problems. This research aims to investigate the behavior and evaluate the dynamics of individual oil drops in an oil-in-water dispersion within an ESP impeller. The study adopts experimental and numerical approaches. Initially, experiments were performed using an experimental facility with a high-speed camera and an ESP prototype working at 600 rpm and 900 rpm, for water flows around the Best Efficiency Point (BEP) and with the injection of oil drops at a low flow rate. The acquired images were processed, and a drop sample was tracked, enabling the analysis of the size, shape, path, velocity, and acceleration of the oil drops. Numerical simulations were executed in ANSYS® software to define relevant parameters related to water and oil drops, such as velocities, accelerations, forces, turbulent dissipation, and residence time. The images reveal a unique flow pattern of dispersed drops in a continuous water phase. The oil drops' diameters vary from tenths of a millimeter to around 3 mm. The drops' trajectories can be classified into three different regions within the impeller channels. The drops' velocities stay in the order of 1 m/s, while accelerations can reach hundreds of m/s2. The velocity profiles show that the oil drops tend to decelerate during their trajectory, while the acceleration profiles suggest peaks at the channel inlet and outlet. High intense turbulence is present in the impeller entrance zone. The evaluation of the residence time and the particle Reynolds number suggest that smaller oil drops follow the water streamlines, while larger oil drops tend to be affected by external forces. The main forces that govern the oil drop motion are the drag, the pressure gradient, and the virtual mass forces. The force from the pressure gradient is tenfold greater than the force from the drag. The virtual mass effect is significant only in the impeller inlet. In general, in this research, numerical results show a satisfactory agreement with the experimental data.",2019,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,881–895,,,175,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CFD; Centrifugal pump; Flow visualization; Oil drop dynamics; Two-phase liquid-liquid flow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent accumulation of genomic data on human cancer via next-generation sequencing confirmed that cancer is a disease of genome alteration. In many cancers, the Nrf2 transcription system is activated via mutations either in Nrf2 or Keap1 ubiquitin ligase, leading to persistent activation of the genes with antioxidative functions. Furthermore, deep sequencing of passenger mutations is clarifying responsible cancer causative agent(s) in each case, including aging, APOBEC activation, smoking and UV. Therefore, it is most likely that oxidative stress is the principal initiating factor in carcinogenesis, with the involvement of two essential molecules for life, iron and oxygen. There is evidence based on epidemiological and animal studies that excess iron is a major risk for carcinogenesis, suggesting the importance of ferroptosis-resistance. Microscopic visualization of catalytic Fe(II) has recently become available. Although catalytic Fe(II) is largely present in lysosomes, proliferating cells harbor catalytic Fe(II) also in the cytosol and mitochondria. Oxidative stress catalyzed by Fe(II) is counteracted by thiol systems at different functional levels. Nitric oxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen (per)sulfide modulate these reactions. Mitochondria generate not only energy but also heme/iron sulfur cluster cofactors and remain mostly dysfunctional in cancer cells, leading to Warburg effects. Cancer cells are under persistent oxidative stress with a delicate balance between catalytic iron and thiols, thereby escaping ferroptosis. Thus, high-dose L-ascorbate and non-thermal plasma as well as glucose/glutamine deprivation may provide additional benefits as cancer therapies over preexisting therapeutics.",2017,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,610–626,,,108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cancer; Carcinogenesis; Ferroptosis; Iron; Redox signaling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several scenarios were tested to evaluate different charging event opportunities and their impacts on electric mobility feasibility. In more detail, scenario 1 considered that vehicles would recharge whenever they are stopped for 2, 4 or 6 h, either on weekdays or weekend days; scenario 2 tested the hypothesis of recharging only during the night period; and scenario 3 assumed that vehicles would recharge during the day on weekdays. Furthermore, the potential energy impacts of electric mobility at a city level, by applying a driver and street level approach, were also estimated. Results revealed that electric mobility is highly feasible for weekday urban trips, while weekend trips due to their higher average distance are less suitable to be performed by EVs. Scenario 1, due to its higher recharging opportunities was found to be the best-case scenario. In this case, the percentage of eligible trips was found to be equal to or higher than 94% and 88% on weekdays and weekend days, respectively. Results showed also the lower electric mobility feasibility if considering only daytime charging, on weekdays (scenario 3). However, if considering night charging (scenario 2), the electric mobility eligibility was found to improve significantly. When considering a street level analysis, the potential reduction in energy consumption ranges in average from −60 to −70%, enabling the visualization of higher EV potential, with increasing potential for reducing energy consumption for increasing road grades. Concluding, since electric mobility is particularly suited for urban driving and most households detain 2 or more vehicles, there is a high potential to replace at least one ICEV by an EV. In this case, people may adapt their driving behavior, using the EV for their day-to-day urban driving while the ICEV would be used for longer trips. Nonetheless, the capacity to recharge during night plays a significant role on trips eligibility. Therefore, the availability of home-charge set-ups or a much higher deployment of public charging stations at residential locations are required in order to incentivize drivers to shift towards electric mobility.",2019,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,646–660,,,206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Electric vehicles; Feasibility analysis; Mobility characterization; Naturalistic driving data; Street level,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We thoroughly analyzed the antigenic surface of the important pregnancy and tumor marker human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a cystine knot (ck) growth factor, and set antigenic domains and epitopes in molecular relationships to each other. Antigenic domains on hCG, its free hCGα and hCGβ subunits are dependent on appropriate inherent molecular features such as molecular accessibility and protrusion indices that determine bulging structures accessible to Abs. The banana-shaped intact hCG comprises ∼7500\AA2 of antigenic surface with minimally five antigenic domains that encompass a continuum of overlapping non-linear composite epitopes, not taking into account the C-terminal peptide extension of hCGβ (hCGβCTP). Epitopes within an antigenic domain are defined by specific Abs, that bury nearly 1000\AA2 of surface accessible area on the antigen and recognize a few up to 15 amino acid (aa) residues, whereby between 2 and 5 of these provide the essential binding energy. Variability in Ab binding modes to the contact aa residues are responsible for the variation in affinity and intra- and inter-species specificity, e.g. cross-reactions with luteinizing hormone (LH). Each genetically distinct fragment antigen binding (Fab) defines its own epitope. Consequently, recognition of the same epitope by different Abs is only possible in cases of genetically identical sequences of its binding sites. Due to combinatorial V(D)J gene segment variability of heavy and light chains, Abs defining numerous epitopes within an antigenic domain can be generated by different individuals and species. Far more than hundred Abs against the immuno-dominant antigenic domains of either subunit at both ends of the hCG-molecule, the tips of peptide loops one and three (\L1+3) protruding from the central ck, encompassing hCGβ\L1+3 (aa 20–25+64+68–81) and hCGα\L1 (aa 13–22; Pro16, Phe17, Phe18) plus hCGα\L3 (Met71, Phe74), respectively, have been identified in the two “ISOBM Tissue Differentiation-7 Workshops on hCG and Related Molecules” and in other studies. These Abs recognize distinct but overlapping epitopes with slightly different specificity profiles and affinities. Heterodimeric-specific epitopes involve neighboring α\L1 plus β\L2 (hCGβ44/45 and 47/48). Diagnostically important Abs recognize the middle of the molecule, the ck (aa Arg10, Arg60 and possibly Gln89) and the linear hCGβCTP “tail” (aa 135–145; Asp139, Pro144, Gln145), respectively. Identification of antigenic domains and of specific epitopes is essential for harmonization of Abs in methods that are used for reliable and robust hCG measurements for the management of pregnancy, pregnancy-related disease and tumors.",2016,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,134–145,,,76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Antigenic domains; Harmonizing immunoassays; hCG; Number of epitopes; Pregnancy testing; Variants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IoT acts as an enabler to interconnect intelligent and self-configurable nodes “things” to establish an efficient and dynamic platform for communication and collaboration. IoT is becoming a major source of big data, contributing huge amounts of streamed information from a large number of interconnected nodes, which have to be stored, processed, and presented in an efficient, and easily interpretable form. Cloud computing can enable IoT to have the privilege of a virtual resources utilization infrastructure, which integrates storage devices, visualization platforms, resource monitoring, analytical tools, and client delivery. Given the number of things connected and the amount of data generated, a key challenge is the energy efficient composition and interoperability of heterogeneous things integrated with cloud resources and scattered across the globe, in order to create an on-demand energy efficient cloud based IoT application. In many cases, when a single service is not enough to complete the business requirement; a composition of web services is carried out. These composed web services are expected to collaborate towards a common goal with large amount of data exchange and various other operations. Massive data sets have to be exchanged between several geographically distributed and scattered services. The movement of mass data between services influences the whole application process in terms of energy consumption. One way to significantly reduce this massive data exchange is to use fewer services for a composition, which need to be created to complete a business requirement. Integrating fewer services can result in a reduction in data interchange, which in return helps in reducing the energy consumption and carbon footprint. This paper develops a novel multi-cloud IoT service composition algorithm called (E2C2) that aims at creating an energy-aware composition plan by searching for and integrating the least possible number of IoT services, in order to fulfil user requirements. A formal user requirements translation and transformation modelling and analysis is adopted for the proposed algorithm.

China has relied upon fossil fuel for several decades, which caused China to produce the largest CO2 emission and to influence climate change in the world. Thus, China's fossil fuel-dependent power sector needs to reduce CO2 emission. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of the solutions to decrease CO2 emission, and geological CO2 sequestration (GCS) is recommended considering its high potential and effectiveness. In this study, the efforts to implement geological CO2 sequestration in China are reviewed, and current technical issues are addressed. The potential storage candidates including depleted oil and gas reservoirs, unminable coal seams, saline aquifers, and hydrate bearing sediments are introduced with the data collected from the pilot, demonstration, and large-scale projects in China. Among potential sites, saline aquifers have been considered as sites with the highest potential for CO2 storage in China because of their enormous capacity. Main trapping mechanisms including structural-, capillary residual-, solubility- and mineral-trappings support saline aquifers as the most possible CO2 storage site. Also, CO2 injectivity and CO2-brine displacement efficiency in saline aquifers are explored to improve the efficiency of CO2 injection with current techniques including visualizing experimental testing method for two-phase immiscible flow such as microfluidic model and X-ray computed tomography (X-CT) method.

Methods Two identical, miniature pixelated NaI(Tl) gamma cameras were fabricated and installed “looking up” through the tabletop of a compact portable cart. Mice are placed directly on the tabletop for imaging. Camera imaging performance was evaluated with phantoms and field performance was evaluated in a weeklong In-111 imaging study performed in a mouse tumor xenograft model. Results Tc-99m performance measurements, using a photopeak energy window of 140 keV±10%, yielded the following results: spatial resolution (FWHM at 1 cm), 2.2 mm; sensitivity, 149 cps (counts per seconds)/MBq (5.5 cps/μCi); energy resolution (FWHM, full width at half maximum), 10.8%; count rate linearity (count rate vs. activity), r2=0.99 for 0–185 MBq (0–5 mCi) in the field of view (FOV); spatial uniformity, <3% count rate variation across the FOV. Tumor and whole-body distributions of the In-111 agent were well visualized in all animals in 5-min images acquired throughout the 168-h study period. Conclusion Performance measurements indicate that MONICA is well suited to whole-body single photon mouse imaging. The field study suggests that inter-device communications and user-oriented interfaces included in the MONICA design facilitate use of the system in practice.

There are total 15 element occurred in this series including La3+, Ce3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, Pm3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, HO3+, Er3+, Tm3+, Yb3+, and Lu3+. These elements are arranged on the basis of atomic number. From the long years, back lanthanide elements are used as dopant ions in many inorganic host lattices such as aluminates, borates, silicates, tungstate, fluoride, phosphate, and vanadates. In past few years, a lot of study had been carried out on the location of lanthanide level into band structure of several inorganic host compounds. This type of study is very much useful to predicting the exact location of lanthanide level and 4f-electron binding energies based on some theoretical model to calculate red shift, centroid shift, charge transfer, and chemical shift. These are studied on the basis of the observed spectroscopic data to draw the host referred binding energy level scheme in which the 4fn and 4fn−1 5d levels for all divalent and trivalent lanthanides ions are placed relative to the top of the V·B; however, in case of vacuum referred binding energy scheme, all the energy levels are relative to that of an electron at rest in vacuum. Therefore, such energy level scheme provided methods for the visualization of the relevant location of lanthanide levels in relative in the band structure of the inorganic host lattice. Also, we know that the application of lanthanide-doped inorganic host depends upon the observed photophysical properties. Among the 15 lanthanide element, Ce3+, Pr3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Tb3+, and Dy3+ are potentially used in LEDs and display devices. However, the other elements such as Nd3+, HO3+, Er3+, Tm3+, and Yb3+ show near visible-NIR emission spectra and exhibit the emission bands in visible to NIR range. Recently, upconversion luminescent nanoparticle is proposed for wastewater treatment. In past few years, researcher reported many types of lanthanide-doped luminescent host materials for lighting devices. But only few of them are commercially used. Currently, QD-based LEDs attract the attention of many researchers worldwide due to their high brightness and high quantum yield. Only few materials are reported for such types of LED applications. Hence, the search for new luminescent materials and QDs is not end in near future due to continuous innovation and development in exiting indoor and outdoor lighting technology. Recently, lanthanide-doped (Ce3+, Pr3+, Sm3+, Yb2+, Nd3+, etc.) oxide materials show excellent luminescence properties in UV visible to NIR range and also applicable as an active layer on the front surface to improve conversion efficiency of Si solar cell. Among the different types of renewable and sustainable source of energy, solar energy is a prominent and a clean source for energy generation. Thus, PV solar cells are the nonpolluting energy source of the 21st century. And it is well known that Si solar cell is everywhere accepted for the PV application than the other PV devices like organic solar cell, perovskite solar cell, Tandem solar cell, and CdTe cell. It is most commercially used from few years. Now, researchers are focused on finding other alternatives for Si cell and also they are taking an effort on how to increase the efficiency of existing Si solar cell. Therefore, the luminescent materials with UC/DC phosphor mechanism were theoretically and practically proposed by many research groups to enhance the PV response of Si solar cell. Hence, the lanthanide ions play an important role in modifying the optical, electronic, electrical, and catalytic activity when it doped with some host lattices.

Electrodes of the IDT are precisely machined by a laser machining technique and its acoustical wave properties are characterized by using a scanning laser interferometry system with a spatial resolution of less than 10 microns. Unlike the conventional contact surface wave generation methods using wedges or combs, the biggest advantage of an IDT are its miniature physical size and its high efficiency in converting electrical signals to mechanical vibrations. Narrow band surface waves with finite amplitudes generated by an IDT are used to investigate the wave interaction with a tightly closed fatigue crack on a metallic test specimen. High-resolution images for the time-resolved ultrasonic field and time-averaged amplitude displacement are generated to understand the interaction of the wave with a surface-breaking fatigue crack. From the amplitude displacement data, three-dimensional surface contour plots of the wave energy are generated to find out how the elastic energy interacts with the tight fatigue crack interfaces. Results show that a tightly closed fatigue crack can transmit Rayleigh waves through the crack due to interfacial contact within the crack, where transmission of elastic energy was found to be more dominant towards the crack tip as expected. The sum of transmitted and reflected energy at the crack interface suggests that there is an additional energy loss mechanism which is proved experimentally by visualizing part of the incident Rayleigh wave energy propagating along the interfacial surfaces of the crack and continues its propagation along the surface of the opposite side of the test specimen.",2010,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,432–439,,5,43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Fatigue crack; Interdigital transducer (IDT); Laser interferometry; Rayleigh surface waves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the existing standardized models focus on describing objects in and around urban architectural void rather than the spaces themselves. Nevertheless, a number of phenomena such as heat, energy, pollution, also including social and mobility aspects would undoubtedly benefit from using a model that is explicitly focused on defining the urban architectural void and its characteristics as continuous field, interconnected network or series of spatial units. Therefore, this paper aims to suggest a versatile data model that would allow to separate, interpret, analyze and visualize the urban architectural void using a standardized automated procedure. The model relies on Gestalt theories for space compartmentalization. It allows performing various kinds of analysis and storing their results in a unified format using core concepts of GIS. The model can be rendered both as a 2D and 3D representation. Finally, user intervention and parameter calibration is allowed at every principal step of an automated procedure.",2017,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,130–144,,,66,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Urban computing; Convex partitioning; Spatial data modeling; Urban architectural void,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, managers of intensive production facilities need accurate, real-time information on system status and performance in order to maximize their potential. This work has developed and deployed low cost short-range modules of wireless sensor network based on ZigBee standard and virtual instruments technology in order to monitor and control an aquaculture system in real time. The system consists of smart sensor nodes, coordinator/gateway node and personal computer (PC). The smart sensor nodes monitor environmental parameters such as dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH and water level using relevant sensors, transmit this information to the coordinator/gateway node through ZigBee network and receive control signals for actuator control. The coordinator/gateway node receives data acquired and sends command to PC in order to achieve human–computer visualization interface. The graphical user interface (GUI) was designed by LabWindows/CVI software platform so that users can observe, investigate and analyze the related scientific and accuracy of parameters in aquaculture environment. We have implemented our method for two sensor network nodes deployed in fish ponds and monitored the results for six months indicating that the power management and networking solutions adopted to work in practice, lead to maximize monitoring, control as well as the recording of the aquaculture system. It effectively reduces the probability of high risk of fish mortality through enabling constant monitoring of the critical parameters in the aquaculture environment. This situation in effect increases economic benefit for aquaculture, consumer confidence and safety while reducing labor cost and energy consumption.",2014,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,31–42,,,102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aquaculture; Environmental parameters; LabWindows/CVI; Monitoring and control; Wireless sensor network; ZigBee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MODAR has been designed to handle time-energy data issued by MCNP simulations of neutron inspection devices using the associated particle technique. MODAR exploits ROOT's Graphical User Interface and functionalities to visualize and process MCNP simulation results in a fast and user-friendly way. MODAR allows to take into account the detection system time resolution (which is not possible with MCNP) as well as detectors energy response function and counting statistics in a straightforward way.

Examples where tested under Suse Linux and Windows XP. RAM: Depends on the size of the MCNP output file. The example presented in the article, which involves three two dimensional 139×740 bins histograms, allocates about 60 MB. These data are running under ROOT and include consumption by ROOT itself. Classification: 17.6 Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEGA_v1_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 181 (2010) 1161 External routines: ROOT version 5.24.00 (http://root.cern.ch/drupal/) Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: The output of a MCNP simulation is an ascii file. The data processing is usually performed by copying and pasting the relevant parts of the ascii file into Microsoft Excel. Such an approach is satisfactory when the quantity of data is small but is not efficient when the size of the simulated data is large, for example when time-energy correlations are studied in detail such as in problems involving the associated particle technique. In addition, since the finite time resolution of the simulated detector cannot be modeled with MCNP, systems in which time-energy correlation is crucial cannot be described in a satisfactory way. Finally, realistic particle energy deposit in detectors is calculated with MCNP in a two step process involving type-5 then type-8 tallies. In the first step, the photon flux energy spectrum associated to a time region is selected and serves as a source energy distribution for the second step. Thus, several files must be manipulated before getting the result, which can be time consuming if one needs to study several time regions or different detectors performances. In the same way, modeling counting statistics obtained in a limited acquisition time requires several steps and can also be time consuming. Solution method: In order to overcome the previous limitations, the MODAR C++ code has been written to make use of CERN's ROOT data analysis software. MCNP output data are read from the MCNP output file with dedicated routines. Two dimensional histograms are filled and can be handled efficiently within the ROOT framework. To keep a user friendly analysis tool, all processing and data display can be done by means of ROOT Graphical User Interface. Specific routines have been written to include detectors finite time resolution and energy response function as well as counting statistics in a straightforward way. Reasons for new version: For applications involving the Associate Particle Technique, a large number of gamma rays are produced by the fast neutrons interactions. To study the energy spectra, it is useful to identify the gamma-ray energy peaks in a straightforward way. Therefore, the possibility to show gamma rays corresponding to specific reactions has been added in MODAR. Summary of revisions: It is possible to use a gamma ray database to better identify in the energy spectra gamma ray peaks with their first and second escapes. Histograms can be scaled by the number of source particle to evaluate the number of counts that is expected without statistical uncertainties. Additional comments: The possibility of adding tallies has also been incorporated in MODAR in order to describe systems in which the signal from several detectors can be summed. Moreover, MODAR can be adapted to handle other problems involving two dimensional data. Running time: The CPU time needed to smear a two dimensional histogram depends on the size of the histogram. In the presented example, the time-energy smearing of one of the 139×740 two dimensional histograms takes 3 minutes with a DELL computer equipped with IN℡ Core 2.",2010,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,2210–2211,,12,181,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,C++; Data processing; MCNP; Object-oriented programming; ROOT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The final version of the PPI will be integrated into the MONICA portable dual-gamma camera system to allow the user to interchangeably image either single photon or positron-emitting compounds in a shared software and hardware environment. Methods A mouse is placed in the mid-plane between two identical, opposed, pixelated LYSO arrays separated by 21.8-cm and in time coincidence. An image of the distribution of positron decays in the animal is formed on this mid-plane by coincidence events that fall within a small cone angle perpendicular to the two detectors and within a user-specified energy window. We measured the imaging performance of this device with phantoms and in tests performed in mice injected with various compounds labeled with positron-emitting isotopes. Results Representative performance measurements yielded the following results (energy window 250–650keV, cone angle 3.5°): resolution in the image mid-plane, 1.66-mm (FWHM), resolution ±1.5-cm above and below the image plane, 2.2-mm (FWHM), sensitivity: 0.237-cps/kBq (8.76-cps/μCi) 18F (0.024% absolute). Energy resolution was 15.9% with a linear-count-rate operating range of 0–14.8MBq (0–400μCi) and a corrected sensitivity variation across the field-of-view of <3%. Whole-body distributions of [18F] FDG and [18F] fluoride were well visualized in mice of typical size. Conclusion Performance measurements and field studies indicate that the PPI is well suited to whole-body positron projection imaging of mice. When integrated into the MONICA gamma camera system, the PPI may be particularly useful early in the drug development cycle where, like MONICA, basic whole-body biodistribution data can direct future development of the agent under study and where logistical factors (e.g., available imaging space, non-portability, and cost) may be limitations.",2013,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,321–330,,3,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cancer drug development; Mouse whole-body imaging; Positron projection imaging; Pre-clinical imaging,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such changes impact the capacity of ecosystems to provide goods and services to the human society. This supply of multiple goods and services by nature should match the demands of the society, if self-sustaining human–environmental systems and a sustainable utilization of natural capital are to be achieved. To describe respective states and dynamics, appropriate indicators and data for their quantification, including quantitative and qualitative assessments, are needed. By linking land cover information from, e.g. remote sensing, land survey and GIS with data from monitoring, statistics, modeling or interviews, ecosystem service supply and demand can be assessed and transferred to different spatial and temporal scales. The results reveal patterns of human activities over time and space as well as the capacities of different ecosystems to provide ecosystem services under changing land use. Also the locations of respective demands for these services can be determined. As maps are powerful tools, they hold high potentials for visualization of complex phenomena. We present an easy-to-apply concept based on a matrix linking spatially explicit biophysical landscape units to ecological integrity, ecosystem service supply and demand. An exemplary application for energy supply and demand in a central German case study region and respective maps for the years 1990 and 2007 are presented. Based on these data, the concept for an appropriate quantification and related spatial visualization of ecosystem service supply and demand is elaborated and discussed.",2012,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,17–29,,,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>Challenges of sustaining natural capital and ecosystem services</p>,,,GIS; CORINE land cover; Ecological integrity; Ecosystem functions; Ecosystem service footprint; Ecosystem service maps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is difficult to account for this uncertainty in the design phase when operational and occupancy profiles are unknown. The relevant “performance gap” usually encountered between simulated and measured energy performance is clearly connected to biased assumptions in modeling, especially in the initial design phase. A probabilistic modeling approach is proposed to improve simulation reliability and robustness with respect to variability in occupancy patterns. The case study presented is the eLUX lab of the “Smart Campus” of Brescia University in Italy. Occupancy dependent input parameters such as air change rates (i.e. mechanically controlled ventilation) and internal heat gains (i.e. due to people, lighting and appliances) are described by means of probability distributions to obtain probabilistic thermal demand and load profiles as output. Probabilistic results enables a more reliable identification of energy saving strategies (operational and environmental settings) with respect to highly variable operating conditions. Further, simulation data are processed to obtain a weather-adjusted energy demand visualization, suitable for establishing a continuity between modeling in design and operation phases, with calibration purpose. Calibrated energy models can be used for several specific tasks in the operation phase, in particular condition monitoring, fault detection and diagnosis, supervisory control and energy management. For the case study presented, a detailed data acquisition scheme has been designed to enable an effective monitoring activity in the operation phase, aimed at experimenting model-based approaches for the tasks reported. The proposed research is the point-of-departure for a general activity aimed at assessing critically the issues of reliability and robustness of simulation results obtained with conventional modeling approaches, in particular with respect to occupants' behaviour, exploiting at the same time the possibility of using measured data as a direct feedback to promote behavioural change.",2016,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,119–131,,,128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Energy management; Energy efficiency; Behavioural learning; Behavioural modeling; Building performance simulation; Probabilistic modeling; Uncertainty propagation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The complexes were designed with a view to assess their potential anticancer, antioxidant and antibacterial activity. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) properties of the chosen ligands were calculated by admetSAR software. Metabolic sites of different ligands likely to undergo metabolism were predicted using Metaprint 2D. The proposed complexes were also evaluated for their drug-like quality based on Lipinski's, Veber, Ghose and leadlikeness filters. Druglikeness and toxicity potential were predicted by OSIRIS property explorer. The pharmacokinetic properties and bioactivity scores were calculated by Molinspiration tool. Bioactivity scores of the complexes were predicted for drug targets including enzymes, nuclear receptors, kinase inhibitors, G-protein coupled receptor ligands and ion channel modulators. Molecular docking of selected Fe(II) mixed-ligand complexes was performed using AutoDock version 4.2.6 and i-GEMDOCK version 2.1 with two target proteins namely Ribonucleotide reductase (RR) and Topoisomerase II (Topo II). The results were compared with three standard reference drugs viz. Doxorubicin HCl, Letrozole (anticancer) and Tetracycline (antibiotic). Multivariate data obtained were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) for visualization and projection as scatter and 3D plots. Positive results obtained for hetero-ligands using admetSAR version 1.0 indicated good absorption and transport kinetics of the hetero-ligand complexes through the human intestine and blood-brain barrier. The hetero-ligands were predicted to have no associated mutagenic effect(s) also. However, none of the hetero-ligands was predicted to be Caco-2 (human colon cancer cell line) permeable. Most of the hetero-ligands and the parent ligand (2-butanone thiosemicarbazone) were predicted to undergo Phase-I metabolism prior to excretion using MetaPrint2D software. Pharmacokinetic evaluation of the proposed complexes revealed that all complexes displayed drug-like character and were predicted to have no apparent toxic side-effects. All the proposed complexes showed moderate to good biological activity scores (−5.0 to 0.0). Mixed complexes with bpy, 2-picoline and 1,10-phenanthroline showed significant bioactivity scores (as enzyme inhibitors) in the range 0.02–0.13. Likewise, good docking scores were obtained for Fe (II) complexes with the same ligands. [FeL(2-pic)2] displayed the lowest binding energy (−6.47 kcal/mol) with respect to Topo II followed by [FeL(py)2] (−6.14 kcal/mol) as calculated by AutoDock version 4.2.6. With respect to binding with RR, [FeL(2–pic)2] again displayed the lowest binding energy (−7.21 kcal/mol) followed by [FeL(py)2] (−5.96 kcal/mol). On the basis of docking predictions and various other computational evaluations, four mixed-ligand complexes of Fe in +2 oxidation state with py, bpy, 2–picoline and 1,10-phenanthroline were synthesized with 2-butanone thiosemicarbazone. All the synthesized Fe complexes were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques and tested for their potential anticancer activity in vitro against human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB 231 and human lung carcinoma cell line A549 cell line using MTT assay. [FeL(2-pic)2], [FeL(bpy)], and [FeL(py)2] were found to exhibit significant antiproliferative activity with IC50 values in the range of 80–100 μM against breast and lung cancer cells. The synthesized Fe complexes also displayed mild antioxidant activities. The synthesized and studied Fe complexes have the potential for development into future anticancer agents if analyzed and modified further for improvement of their ADMET, solubility and permeability criteria set for potential drug-candidates.",2018,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,178–195,,,75,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Principal component analysis; Anticancer; Antioxidant; Bioactivity prediction; Design; Docking; Drug interaction; Pharmacokinetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 63.5% of the territory is forested area (more than 2 million Ha), from which 60.5% is wooded land. The main activity of the timber industry is the manufacture of wood packaging using 85% of the sawnwood to manufacture pallets, which is the most common wood product manufactured in the region. In the case of Europe, around 20% of all sawnwood consumption is used for wooden pallets and packaging. This research analyzes the impact of the conifers wood supply chain for the sawnwood and pallet production, from forest operations to the gate of the production facility. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was applied to both products (sawnwood and pallet) using primary data provided by the industry in order to identify the most impactful points of the life cycle. Six midpoint impact categories using Recipe methodology were assessed: Climate change, Ozone depletion, Terrestrial acidification, Freshwater eutrophication, Human toxicity; Agricultural land occupation and Water depletion. Also, Cumulative Energy Demand was assessed. It was found that electricity consumption is the most impacting input in the sawnwood and pallet production, followed by pesticide used in the production. For pallet case, steel plays a key role. Possible improvements were identified with a big potential of impacts reduction.

The evolution of the enzymatic machinery responsible for the biosynthesis and degradation of such polysaccharides, led the development of mechanisms to control the assembly and disassembly rate, to store and recover glucose according to cell energy demands. The tetrameric enzyme ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) catalyzes and regulates the initial step in the biosynthesis of both α-polyglucans. AGPase displays cooperativity and allosteric regulation by sensing metabolites from the cell energy flux. The understanding of the allosteric signal transduction mechanisms in AGPase arises as a long-standing challenge. In this work, we disclose the cryoEM structures of the paradigmatic homotetrameric AGPase from Escherichia coli (EcAGPase), in complex with either positive or negative physiological allosteric regulators, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and AMP respectively, both at 3.0 \AA resolution. Strikingly, the structures reveal that FBP binds deeply into the allosteric cleft and overlaps the AMP site. As a consequence, FBP promotes a concerted conformational switch of a regulatory loop, RL2, from a “locked” to a “free” state, modulating ATP binding and activating the enzyme. This notion is strongly supported by our complementary biophysical and bioinformatics evidence, and a careful analysis of vast enzyme kinetics data on single-point mutants of EcAGPase. The cryoEM structures uncover the residue interaction networks (RIN) between the allosteric and the catalytic components of the enzyme, providing unique details on how the signaling information is transmitted across the tetramer, from which cooperativity emerges. Altogether, the conformational states visualized by cryoEM reveal the regulatory mechanism of EcAGPase, laying the foundations to understand the allosteric control of bacterial glycogen biosynthesis at the molecular level of detail.",2020,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,89–103,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Enzyme allosterism; Glycogen biosynthesis; Glycogen regulation; Nucleotide sugar biosynthesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scalar and vector fields, such as the gradient of the electron density (∇ρ), electron localization function (ELF) and its gradient, localized orbital locator (LOL), region of slow electrons (RoSE), reduced density gradient, localized electrons detector (LED), information entropy, molecular electrostatic potential, kinetic energy densities K and G, among others, can be evaluated on zero, one, two, and three dimensional grids. The suite includes a program for searching critical points and bond paths of the electron density, under the framework of Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules. DensToolKit also evaluates the momentum space electron density on spatial grids, and the reduced density matrix of order one along lines joining two arbitrary atoms of a molecule. The source code is distributed under the GNU-GPLv3 license, and we release the code with the intent of establishing an open-source collaborative project.

In this paper, we present some of the most salient features of the programs contained in the suite, some examples of how to run them, and the mathematical definitions of the implemented fields along with hints of how we optimized their evaluation. We benchmarked our suite against both a freely-available program and a commercial package. Speed-ups of ∼2×, and up to 12× were obtained using a non-parallel compilation of DensToolKit for the evaluation of fields. DensToolKit takes similar times for finding critical points, compared to a commercial package. Finally, we present some perspectives for the future development and growth of the suite. Program summary Program title: DensToolKit Catalogue identifier: AEXI_v1_0 Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEXI_v1_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU, General Public License, version 3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 142037 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 5517409 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: C++, bash. Computer: Any. Operating system: Linux, MacOSX, Windows (cygwin). RAM: The memory requirements grow quadratically with the number of primitives describing the wavefunction. A wavefunction with 1,500 primitives uses ∼17MB, and 2GB RAM are enough to process wavefunctions of around 10,000 primitives. A few more MB may be needed by some of the most demanding programs of the package if the number of primitives is large. Classification: 6.5, 7.3, 16, 16.1. External routines: (optional) gnuplot, povray, epstool, Graphics-Magick, epstopdf Nature of problem: The study of the electron density of molecules, some reactivity indices, and the topology of the electron density can be used to analyze the chemical nature, stability and reactivity of those molecules. Furthermore, the study of the electron density and functionals of it may help us in gaining a better understanding of the chemical bond. Reactivity indices and the molecular topological properties may also aid in molecular design. Solution method: The suite provides several programs in order to compute scalar and vector fields derivatives of the electron density. Those fields are obtained from a wavefunction file, which is in turn obtained from programs such as Nwchem, MolPro, etc. The functions, whereby the fields are computed, are implemented following mathematically standard but computationally optimized and parallelized algorithms built upon the Density Matrix. The suite provides several small but efficient programs, easily scriptable, for evaluation of the fields upon spatial grids. Regarding the topology analysis, the suite uses the algorithm proposed by Popelier, which uses the eigen-values of the Hessian of the electron density for locating the critical points. Bond paths are traced using a fifth-order Runge–Kutta–Dormand–Prince algorithm. Optional visualization of the produced data can be carried out by scripts generated by the suite, which can be parsed later to gnuplot, or povray. In addition, DensToolKit provides an open door for the user to program new scalar or vector fields, with almost complete functionality for evaluating such fields upon the same spatial grids as those implemented for the fields already provided in the suite. Restrictions: Wavefunctions with more than 99 nuclei must be input in wfx format. In the current version, wavefunctions that use pseudopotentials must have only one Additional Electron Density Function (EDF) entry in the wfx file, which in this case is the only accepted input format, and pseudopotential support is provided only in non-parallel compilation. Additional comments: A simple method for implementing new indices (derived from any of the implemented fields) is provided. In this manner, the final user may easily program his/her own scalar or vector field with a few code lines. Running time: Strongly dependent on the number of primitives used for approximating the wavefunction (∼N2p). It also depends on the evaluated number of points and type of field. Wavefunctions comprised of 1,500 primitives may take several hours to complete, while small molecules described by two or three hundred primitives take a few seconds. Typical running times are at least as fast as the times taken by some commercial or freely available codes. In many cases, the programs perform the computations with a speed-up of 2× (with respect to other available programs), and in some cases 10× speed-ups or more can be attained.",2015,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,362–371,,,196,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Electron density; Momentum space; Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules; Reactivity indices; Reduced density matrix of order one; Spatial grids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This requires solutions that have the flexibility to run site analysis on social surroundings and the compatibility of user programming in the early design stage.

After a decade of research and development we established the GeoPET as a non-destructive method with unrivalled sensitivity and selectivity, with due spatial and temporal resolution by applying Positron Emission Tomography (PET), a nuclear medicine imaging method, to dense rock material. Requirements for reaching the physical limit of image resolution of nearly 1mm are (a) a high-resolution PET-camera, like our ClearPET scanner (Raytest), and (b) appropriate correction methods for scatter and attenuation of 511keV—photons in the dense geological material. The latter are by far more significant in dense geological material than in human and small animal body tissue (water). Here we present data from Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) reflecting selected GeoPET experiments. The MCS consider all involved nuclear physical processes of the measurement with the ClearPET-system and allow us to quantify the sensitivity of the method and the scatter fractions in geological media as function of material (quartz, Opalinus clay and anhydrite compared to water), PET isotope (18F, 58Co and 124I), and geometric system parameters.

These long gaps may not be addressed using simple linear interpolation. The option of only using the available data for descriptive statistics would produce results that are biased towards the season of measurement. In addition discarding the incomplete data represents a significant waste of time and effort in the research study. A work around to reduce the bias problem is to predict the missing data from other measured variables using machine-learning techniques. Some questions that follow are: How much data is necessary to be able to train a regression model? What is the expected error of such prediction? What is the best model for such a task? This paper addresses the problem of completing a data set for the interior temperatures inside a passive house using different monitored predictors such as exterior temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure and electrical energy use inside the building. Two regression models, multiple linear regression and random forest are compared using learning curves for the training and testing sets for visualizing the so-called bias-variance trade off.

Assessment of plaque stability requires imaging of both structure and composition. Spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) imaging can visualize atherosclerotic plaque composition on the basis of the optical absorption contrast. It is an established fact that the frequency content of the photoacoustic (PA) signal is correlated with structural tissue properties. As PA signals can be weak, it is important to match the transducer bandwidth to the signal frequency content for in vivo imaging. In this ex vivo study on human coronary arteries, we combined sPA imaging and analysis of frequency content of the PA signals. Using a broadband transducer (−3-dB one-way bandwidth of 10–35 MHz) and a 1-mm needle hydrophone (calibrated for 1–20 MHz), we covered a large frequency range of 1–35 MHz for receiving the PA signals. Spectroscopic PA imaging was performed at wavelengths ranging from 1125 to 1275 nm with a step of 2 nm, allowing discrimination between plaque lipids and adventitial tissue. Under sPA imaging guidance, the frequency content of the PA signals from the plaque lipids was quantified. Our data indicate that more than 80% of the PA energy of the coronary plaque lipids lies in the frequency band below 8 MHz.

The semi-analytical method used in the newly developed Frankfurt equation of state (FEOS) package provides an easy and fast access to the EOS of – in principle – arbitrary materials. The code is based on the well known QEOS model (More et al., 1988; Young and Corey, 1995) and is a further development of the MPQeos code (Kemp and Meyer-ter Vehn, 1988; Kemp and Meyer-ter Vehn, 1998) from Max-Planck-Institut für Quantenoptik (MPQ) in Garching Germany. The list of features contains the calculation of homogeneous mixtures of chemical elements and the description of the liquid–vapor two-phase region with or without a Maxwell construction. Full flexibility of the package is assured by its structure: A program library provides the EOS with an interface designed for Fortran or C/C++ codes. Two additional software tools allow for the generation of EOS tables in different file output formats and for the calculation and visualization of isolines and Hugoniot shock adiabats. As an example the EOS of fused silica (SiO2) is calculated and compared to experimental data and other EOS codes. Program summary Program Title: FEOS — Frankfurt equation of state Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/6vjsv6v48p.1 Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License version 3 Programming language: C++ Supplementary material: Documentation/manual, exemplary input files for aluminum (Al) and fused silica (SiO2) Nature of problem: The description of a thermodynamic system — e.g. by the solution of the hydrodynamic conservation equations — presumes in the most cases reliable equation of state (EOS) data for different materials and for a wide range in temperature–density space. The FEOS code provides the required thermodynamic quantities like the pressure or the specific internal energy per unit mass as functions of density and temperature for, in principle, arbitrary materials, for single elements as well as for homogeneous mixtures of elements. FEOS is based on the well known QEOS model [2] and is a further development of the MPQeos code [1] from Max-Planck-Institut für Quantenoptik in Garching. Since the model was designed for the high energy density matter regimes, it can be applied e.g. to high-power laser or ion beam and inertial fusion science applications. The most important advantage of the FEOS package is an easy and fast access to materials which may not be available by more complex EOS codes. Solution method: In the QEOS model the thermodynamic quantities are derived from the specific Helmholtz free energy f=ϵ−Ts, which is composed of three contributions f=fe+fi+fb: (1) the uncorrected electronic part fe, calculated by a numerical scheme based on the simple Thomas–Fermi statistical model, (2) the ionic part fi, using the Cowan model [2], which employs analytical formulas to smoothly interpolate between the Debye solid, the normal solid and the liquid states, and (3) the semi-empirical bonding correction fb, which is included to compensate for the negligence of bonding forces in the simple Thomas–Fermi model. Although the total EOS is calculated for a single temperature T=Te=Ti, the user is free to calculate the ionic and the corrected electronic contributions independently with different temperatures. For homogeneous mixtures of elements the partial volumes of all element species k are iteratively adjusted in order to equilibrate the Thomas–Fermi pressures pe,k and to fulfill an additive volume rule for the electronic contribution. Furthermore, in the liquid–vapor two-phase region the model provides the (metastable) EOS with its characteristic features like van-der-Waals loops. The fully equilibrium EOS inside the two-phase region can be calculated by an iterative Maxwell construction scheme. Finally, despite the existence of the bonding correction, pressures near the critical point are often overestimated. Therefore, an improved cold curve can be applied to fit the location of the critical point to theoretical or experimental data. Additional comments: Besides the material's composition, the user must specify a reference density ρo and the bulk modulus Ko=ρ∂p∕∂ρs at a reference point (p,T)=(0,To) for a new material. The reference temperature To is usually chosen such that at p=0 the studied material is in the solid state. All fixed material parameters are stored in a material parameter database file which can be easily exchanged between users. The code is designed to calculate the equation of state within the following density and temperature limits: 10−7≤ρ∕ρo≤106, 10−4eV≤T≤106eV. Homogeneous mixtures with more than three elements may implicate numerical difficulties and/or uneconomical computing times. For temperatures close to and below the critical point one must be careful to check the accuracy of the model. If available, a more complex EOS in this regime is preferable. The FEOS package was designed to provide the best possible flexibility and therefore consists of three parts: (1) the FEOS library which contains all the routines for the calculation of the EOS and which provides a C/C++ as well as a Fortran interface for this purpose, (2) the FEOS table generation tool which accesses the FEOS library in order to generate EOS table files (e.g. in the SESAME database [3] format), and (3) the SHOWEOS table visualization tool which was developed to provide isotherms, isochores, isentropes, and Hugoniot curves from the FEOS or SESAME tables.

We found a relatively dense and branched vascular network in young adults, but a less dense and thinned network in aged adults. Significant reduction in vascular density starts early at the age of 180 days in the region of the spiral limbus (SL) and continues into old age at 540 days. Loss of vascular volume in the region of spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) is delayed until the age of 540 days. In addition, we observed that two vascular accessory cells are closely associated with the microvascular system: perivascular resident macrophages and pericytes. Morphologically, perivascular resident macrophages undergo drastic changes from postnatal P7 to young adult (P30). In postnatal animals, most perivascular resident macrophages exhibit a spherical or nodular shape. In young adult mice, the majority of perivascular resident macrophages are elongated and display an orientation parallel to the vessels. In our imaging, some of the perivascular resident macrophages are caught in the act of transmigrating from the blood circulation. Pericytes also display morphological heterogeneity. In the P7 mice, pericytes are prominent on the capillary walls, relatively large and punctate, and less uniform. In contrast, pericytes in the P30 mice are relatively flat and uniform, and less densely distributed on the vascular network. With triple fluorescence labeling, we did not find obvious physical connection between the two systems, unlike neuronal-vascular coupling found in brain. However, using a fluorescent (FITC-conjugated dextran) tracer and the enzymatic tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP), we observed robust neurovascular exchange, likely through transcytotic transport, evidenced by multiple vesicles present in the endothelial cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate the effectiveness of tissue-clearing methods as an aid in imaging the vascular architecture of the SL and SGNs in whole mounted mouse cochlear preparations. Structure is indicative of function. The finding of differences in vascular structure in postnatal and young adult mice may correspond with variation in hearing refinement after birth and indicate the status of functional activity. The decrease in capillary network density in the older animals may reflect the decreased energy demand from peripheral neural activity. The finding of active transcytotic transport from blood to neurons opens a potential therapeutic avenue for delivery of various growth factors and gene vectors into the inner ear to target SGNs.",2019,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,105–116,,,371,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mouse cochlea; Spiral ganglion neuron; Spiral limbus; Tissue clearing; Vasculature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, using a GPU enables concurrent visualization and interactive segmentation, where the user can help the algorithm to achieve a satisfactory result.

In addition, references to relevant GPU implementations and insight into GPU optimization are provided and discussed.

Adaptive and online learning methods are needed for learning human preferences, using the minimum amount of data possible with quantified uncertainty. This paper presents an online visual preference elicitation learning framework, developed for efficiently learning occupants' visual preference profiles and hidden satisfaction utility functions in daylit offices. A combination of Thompson sampling and pure exploration (uncertainty learning) methods was used in the sequential elicitation framework, to determine the set of successive visual preference queries (for visual conditions) with most information gain. In this way, a balance between exploration and exploitation is realized and the area around the satisfaction utility maximum is learned with minimum number of steps. Experiments with human subjects were conducted in private sidelit offices to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the learning framework. A single-variable model (vertical illuminance) was used to demonstrate the method and visualize results. The entropy of the distribution of the most preferred visual condition is computed for each learned preference profile to quantify the certainty and evaluate the learning efficiency. Our method learns most individual visual preferences to an acceptable certainty level within one day, and indicates the need for personalization. Finally, we discuss the integration of visual preferences into control applications. A switching algorithm is proposed, shifting iteratively between the learning and control modes depending on the certainty of the learned preference model.

The code Sky3D solves the static or dynamic equations on a three-dimensional Cartesian mesh with isolated or periodic boundary conditions and no further symmetry assumptions. Pairing can be included in the BCS approximation for the static case. The code is implemented with a view to allow easy modifications for including additional physics or special analysis of the results. New version program summary Program title: Sky3D Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/vzbrzvyrn4.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Fortran 90. The OpenMP version requires a relatively recent compiler; it was found to work using gfortran 4.6.2 or later and the Intel compiler version 12 or later. Journal reference of previous version: J. A. Maruhn, P.-G. Reinhard, P. D. Stevenson, and A. S. Umar, “The TDHF Code Sky3D”, Comp. Phys. Comm. 185, 2195 (2014). Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes. Nature of problem: The time-dependent Hartree–Fock equations can be used to simulate nuclear vibrations and collisions between nuclei for low energies. This code implements the equations based on a Skyrme energy functional and also allows the determination of the ground-state structure of nuclei through the static version of the equations. For the case of vibrations the principal aim is to calculate the excitation spectra by Fourier-analyzing the time dependence of suitable observables. In collisions, the formation of a neck between nuclei, the dissipation of energy from collective motion, processes like charge transfer and the approach to fusion are of principal interest. Solution method: The nucleonic wave function spinors are represented on a three-dimensional Cartesian mesh with no further symmetry restrictions. The boundary conditions are always periodic for the wave functions, while the Coulomb potential can also be calculated for an isolated charge distribution. All spatial derivatives are evaluated using the finite Fourier transform method. The code solves the static Hartree–Fock equations with a damped gradient iteration method and the time-dependent Hartree–Fock equations with an expansion of the time-development operator. Any number of initial nuclei can be placed into the mesh with arbitrary positions and initial velocities. Reasons for the new version: A few bugs were fixed and a number of enhancements added concerning faster convergence, better stability, and more sophisticated analysis of some results. Summary of revisions: The following is a brief summary. A more complete documentation can be found as update.pdf in the Documentation subdirectory. New documentation: It was decided to switch the documentation to using the Doxygen system (available from www.doxygen.org), which can generate the documentation in a variety of formats. To generate the documentation, go into the Doc-doxygen subdirectory and execute make html, make latex, or make all to produce the corresponding version or both of them. The documentation inserted into the source files accounts for most of the formal changes in them. The general documentation is also updated and present as “Documentation.pdf”. Bug fixes: 1.In the force database forces.data two digits were interchanged in the definition of SLy4d, leading to wrong results for that force.2.If a restart is done for a two-body collision, the code changed the number of fragments to nof =1. The restart is then initialized like a single-nucleus case with nof =1. But two-body analysis was activated only for nof =1 such that it was absent after restart.3.In the time-dependent mode, the wave functions were only save at intervals of mprint and mrest, respectively. If a calculation stops because of reaching the final distance or fulfilling the convergence criterion, this may lead to a loss of information, so that now both are done also in this event before the job finishes.4.The external field parameters were calculated directly from the input in getin_external. Since this is called before the fragment initialization is done, coefficients depending on proton or neutron number will not be calculated correctly. For this reason, the calculation of these coefficients is separated into a new routine init_external, which is called directly before the dynamic calculation starts. Array allocation: It turned out that having the working arrays as automatic variables could cause problems, as they are allocated on the stack and the proper stack size must be calculated. Therefore in all cases where a larger array is concerned, it is now changed to ALLOCATABLE and allocated and deallocated as necessary. Elimination of “guru” mode of FFTW3 While the guru mode as defined in the FFTW3 package (see fftw.org) offers an elegant formulation of complicated multidimensional transforms, it is not implemented in some support libraries like the Intel® MKL. There is not much loss in speed when this is replaced by standard transforms with some explicit loops added where necessary. This affects the wave function transforms in the y and z direction. Enhancement of the makefile In the previous version there were several versions of the makefile, which had to be edited by hand to use different compilers. This was reformulated using a more flexible file with various targets predefined. Thus to generate the executable code, it is sufficient to execute “make target” in the Code subdirectory, where target is one of the following: •seq : simple sequential version with the gfortran compiler.•ifort, ifort_seq : sequential version using the Intel compiler.•omp and ifort_omp produce the OpenMP version for the gfortran and Intel compiler, respectively.•mpi : MPI version, which uses the compiler mpif90.•mpi-omp : MPI version also using OpenMP on each node.•debug, seq_debug, omp_debug, mpi_debug : enable debugging mode for these cases. The first three use the gfortran compiler.•clean : removes the generated object and module files.•clean-exec : same as clean but removes the executable files as well.The generated executable files are called sky3d.seq, sky3d.ifort.seq, sky3d.mpi, sky3d.omp, sky3d.ifort.omp, and sky3d.mpi-omp, which should be self-explanatory. Thus several versions may be kept in the code directory, but a make clean should be done before producing a new version to make sure the object and module files are correct. Skyrme-force compatibility for static restart: the code normally checks that the Skyrme forces for all the input wave functions agree. It may be useful, however, to initialize a static calculation from results for a different Skyrme force. Therefore the consistency check was eliminated for the static case. Acceleration of the static calculations: The basic parameters for the static iterations are (see Eq. 12 of the original paper) x0 (variable x0dmp), which determines the size of the gradient step, and E0 (variable e0dmp) for the energy damping. These were read in and never changed throughout the calculation, except possibly through a restart. This can cause slow convergence, so that a method was developed to change x0dmp during the iterations. The value from the input is now regarded as the minimum allowed one and saved in x0dmpmin. At the start of the iterations, however, x0dmp is multiplied by 3 to attempt a faster convergence. The change in x0dmp is then implemented by comparing the HF energy ehf and the fluctuations efluct1 and efluct2 to the previous values saved in the variables ehfprev, efluct1prev, and efluct2prev. If the energy decreases or one of the fluctuations decreases by a factor of less than 1−10−5, x0dmp is increased by a factor 1.005 to further speed up convergence. If none of these conditions holds, it is assumed that the step was too large and x0dmp is reduced by a factor 0.8, but is never allowed to fall below x0dmpmin. This whole process is turned on only if the input variable tvaryx_0 in the namelist “static” is .TRUE. The default value is .FALSE. A speedup up to a factor of 3 has been observed. External field expectation value This value, which is printed in the file external.res, was calculated from the spatial field including the (time-independent) amplitude amplq0. The temporal Fourier transform then becomes quadratic in the amplitude, as the fluctuations in the density also grow linearly in amplq0 (provided the perturbation is not strong enough to take it into the nonlinear regime). This may be confusing and we therefore divided the expectation value by this factor. Note that if the external field is composed of a mixture of different multipoles (not coded presently), an overall scale factor should instead be used. Enhanced two-body analysis: the analysis of the final two-body quantities after breakup included directly in the code was very simplified and actually it was superfluous to do this so frequently. This is replaced by a much more thorough analysis, including determination of the internal angular momenta of the fragments and of a quite accurate Coulomb energy. It is done only when the final separation is reached, while a simple determination of whether the fragments have separated and, if so, what their distance is, is performed every time step. Diagonalization In the original program the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the subroutine diagstep was carried out employing an eigenvalue decomposition using the LAPACK routine ZHBEVD which is optimized for banded matrices. This routine is replaced in the update by the routine ZHEEVD which is optimized for general hermitian matrices. This change should result in a moderate speed up for very large calculations. Furthermore the array unitary, previously a nstmax × nstmax array has been reduced to a nlin × nlin array, where nlin is the number of wave functions of either neutrons or protons.

Its security and efficiency are of supreme importance to a nation's industrial activities. Energy consumption also has serious environmental impacts in terms of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. In order to use energy more efficiently, simply designing parts and planning manufacturing processes with an energy-aware mindset is insufficient; it is also necessary to model and assess the energy efficiency of a process chain from a holistic point of view. In this work, we propose an integrated energy reduction framework and the internal methods to implement it. Our framework builds on three pillars. Creating an energy profile of a process chain is the first step in characterizing a manufacturing system in terms of energy demand. Energy-aware part designs and process plans are based on ISO/STEP 10303 AP224 standards in order to estimate the embodied energy of a mechanical part. Finally, using discrete event simulation methods, the energy consumption of a process chain is assessed and reduction scenarios are generated based on design or operational alternatives. A data collection and analytics system visualizing measures and key performance indicators (KPIs) also must be implemented in order to measure real consumption values and track improvement results over time. The energy reduction in manufacturing process chains (E-MPC) framework is unique in that it provides a structured method which enables the embodied energy of a part to be estimated during early design stages and further enables the evaluation of design impacts on process chains, thereby recognizing the dynamic nature of systems. A pilot case study of the framework was implemented at the largest household appliance manufacturer in Turkey, Arçelik A.Ş. In order to evaluate its usefulness and validity, we performed a detailed implementation on a fully automated crankshaft manufacturing line in Arçelik's refrigerator compressor plant. The results reveal that design improvements estimated gains would reach 2%, whereas operational improvements yield up to 10% energy savings per produced part.",2016,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,3342–3360,,,112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Energy efficiency; Discrete event simulation; Energy-aware design and process planning; ISO/STEP 10303 AP224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It represents a viable energy source, particularly for stationary power generation, since it allows for a wide flexibility in fossil fuel sources, and since most of the harmful contaminants and pollutants can be removed in the post-gasification process prior to combustion. In this work, two typical mixtures of H2, CO, CH4, CO2 and N2 have been considered as representative of the producer gas coming from wood gasification, and its turbulent combustion at engine-like conditions is made in a rapid compression machine in order to improve current knowledge and provide reference data for modeling and simulation of internal combustion engines. Methane as main constituent of the natural gas is used as reference fuel for comparison reasons. Single compression and compression- expansion events were performed as well direct light visualizations from chemiluminescence emission. There is an opposite behavior of the in-cylinder pressure between single compression and compression–expansion strokes. For single compression, peak pressure decreases as the ignition delay increases. In opposite, for compression–expansion the peak pressure increases as the ignition delay increases. This opposite behavior has to do with the combustion duration under constant volume conditions. Conclusion can be drawn that higher pressures are obtained with methane–air mixture in comparison to both typical syngas compositions. These results could be endorsed to the heat of reaction of the fuels, air to fuel ratio and burning velocity. Another major finding is that syngas typical compositions are characterized by high ignition timings due to its low burning velocities. This could compromise the use of typical syngas compositions on high rotation speed engines.",2011,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,1473–1479,,7,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Compression; Expansion; Rapid compression machine; Syngas; Turbulence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, current limitations of using biodiesel as an alternative fuel for CI engines include a higher viscosity and higher NOx emissions. This is a major issue that could be improved by blending biodiesel with alcohols. This paper investigates the effect of a butanol–acetone mixture (BA) as an additive blended with biodiesel to improve the latter's properties. Macroscopic spray characteristics (spray penetration, spray cone angle and spray volume) were measured in constant volume vessel (CVV) at two injection pressures. A high-speed camera was used to record spray images. The spray's edge was determined using an automatic threshold calculation algorithm to locate the spray outline (edge) from the binary images. In addition, an engine test was carried out experimentally on a single-cylinder diesel engine. The engine's performance was measured using in-cylinder pressure, brake power (BP) and specific fuel consumption (SFC). Emission characteristics NOx, CO and UHC were also measured. Neat biodiesel and three blends of biodiesel with up to 30% added BA were tested. The experimental data were analyzed via ANOVA to evaluate whether variations in parameters due to the different fuels were significant. The results showed that BA can enhance the spray characteristics of biodiesel by increasing both the spray penetration length and the contact surface area, thereby improving air–fuel mixing. The peak in-cylinder pressure for 30% BA was comparable to neat diesel and higher than that of neat biodiesel. Brake power (BP) was slightly improved for 10% BA at an engine speed of 2000 rpm while SFC was not significantly higher for any of the BA-biodiesel blends because of the smaller heating value of BA. Comparing the effect on emissions of adding BA to biodiesel, increasing the amount of BA reduced NOx and CO (7%) and (40%) respectively compared to neat biodiesel, but increased UHC.",2019,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,4729–4739,,4,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Biodiesel; Butanol–acetone mixture; Diesel engine performance; Emissions; Spray visualization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E-Water aims at providing optimal management solutions to enhance food crop production at river basin level. The DSS was applied in the transboundary Mékrou river basin, shared among Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger. The primary sector for local economy in the region is agriculture, contributing significantly to income generation and job creation. Fostering the productivity of regional agricultural requires the intensification of farming practices, promoting additional inputs (mainly nutrient fertilizers and water irrigation) but, also, a more efficient allocation of cropland. In order to cope with the heterogeneity of data, and the analyses and issues required by the WEFE nexus approach, our DSS integrates the following modules: (1) the EPIC biophysical agricultural model; (2) a simplified regression metamodel, linking crop production with external inputs; (3) a linear programming and a multiobjective genetic algorithm optimization routines for finding efficient agricultural strategies; and (4) a user-friendly interface for input/output analysis and visualization. To test the main features of the DSS, we apply it to various real and hypothetical scenarios in the Mékrou river basin. The results obtained show how food unavailability due to insufficient local production could be reduced by, approximately, one third by enhancing the application and optimal distribution of fertilizers and irrigation. That would also affect the total income of the farming sector, eventually doubling it in the best case scenario. Furthermore, the combination of optimal agricultural strategies and modified optimal cropland allocation across the basin would bring additional moderate increases in food self-sufficiency, and more substantial gains in the total agricultural income. The proposed software framework proves to be effective, enabling decision makers to identify efficient and site-specific agronomic management strategies for nutrients and water. Such practices would augment crop productivity, which, in turn, would allow to cope with increasing future food demands, and find a balanced use of natural resources, also taking other economic sectors—like livestock, urban or energy—into account.",2018,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,467–481,,,154,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,African agricultural growth; Best management practices; Food security; Multiobjective optimization; WEFE nexus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the goals of the regulation is to optimize the consumption of his own electricity production and therefore minimize the electricity taken from the grid. Several means are developed to reach the main objective. On one hand, the regulation takes into account the weather forecast to anticipate the future heating's needs and the photovoltaic production. Weather forecast data allows also to optimize the storage in hot water tanks and in the building structure. On the other hand, the project includes the development of an electronic module which collects the monitoring data and gives the commands to the heat pump and the pumps. This is accomplished without any intrusion in the heat pump's own regulation and therefore the user keeps the constructor's warranty. The new regulation was validated numerically.

The high complexity of agricultural machine use over time with its various implements and production processes makes it difficult to automate the operation profile generation for agricultural machinery. Today, modern communication interfaces, like the ISO 11783 (ISOBUS), allow a comfortable data acquisition with comprehensive parameter information of the machine and production process status. This paper describes how the generation of operation profiles can be automated and what kind of machine data and status information are required. Experiments were conducted with a tractor-machine combination during field cultivation. The machine was equipped with a CAN data logger to record ISOBUS messages and GNSS position data during normal operation. A software tool was setup and programmed to drive the data logger. Fields were automatically detected by algorithms to avoid the time consuming manual definition of field boundaries. A graphical user interface simplified the setup and use of the software application. Furthermore, the algorithms analyzed the machine communication regarding the actual machine state based on position, machine activity and work state. The KTBL time classification 2013 was used as a basis for working time analysis as it is designed to divide the overall operational time of agricultural machines into clearly defined, qualitatively different partial time fractions. The machine state could be visualized in the software by a map to show the user where problems occurred e.g. in time losses while waiting or machine breakdown. A diagram presented the timespans spent in different time fractions for comparison to other, similar operations.

A mechanistic multilayer canopy–soil–root system model (MLCan) developed by Drewry et al. (2010a) has been used to capture the emergent vegetation responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 for both C3 and C4 plants under various climate conditions. However, processing input data and setting up such a model can be time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, a graphical user interface that has been developed for MLCan is presented. The design of this interface aims to provide visualization capabilities and interactive support for processing input meteorological forcing data and vegetation parameter values to facilitate the use of this model. In addition, the interface also provides graphical tools for analyzing the forcing data and simulated numerical results. The model and its interface are both written in the MATLAB programming language.

Here we show that tau molecules that lost their normal spatial localization can be detected on a subcellular level in postmortem central nervous system (CNS) tissue sections of AD patients by fluorescence lifetime-based Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Paraffin sections were co-immunostained with two tau-specific monoclonal antibodies recognizing the same epitope, but labeled with distinct fluorescence dyes suitable for spatial resolution at a nanometer scale by lifetime-based FRET. A FRET signal was detected in neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of CNS tissue sections of AD patients, showing associated tau proteins typically reflecting either fibrillary, oligomeric or aggregated tau. The ‘pretangle-like' structures within the neuronal perikarya did not contain spatially pathogenic forms of tau accordingly to this method.

This paper introduces a novel methodology, recommending the best method of capacity planning to change production volumes and to ensure optimal operation in a car factory with respect to several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), e.g. OEE or energy efficiency. The plant's volume transformability will be increased by not only one, but rather many different possible responses to be analyzed by simulation: the so-called production variants. An algorithm determines the most dominant, pre-analyzed production variants from a data base and visualizes the responding strategies based on the predicted KPIs. After a user- and scenario-based weighting by a so-called Balanced Performance Indicator (BPI), an optimal production variant will be selected. Above all, this assistance system provides more variety and transparency for adapting capacities and supports the factory planning both for greenfields by improved testing und comparability of production variants and for brownfields by giving recommendations for action during run-time. Additionally, real measured data can be retrieved in a closed-loop into the data base to design a continuous learning system. The concept has been methodically implemented and validated in a virtual material flow simulation of an automotive body shop cell and is linked to a real demonstration facility at the Brandenburg University of Cottbus-Senftenberg.

Methods Dentin were obtained from crowns of human molars. Enzymatic removal of PGs followed a standard protocol using 1 mg/mL trypsin (Try) for 24 h. Controls were incubated in ammonium bicarbonate buffer. Removal of PGs was assessed by visualization of glycosaminoglycan chains (GAGs) in dentin under transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The dentin matrix swelling ratio was estimated using fully demineralized dentin. Dentin wettability was assessed on wet, dry and re-wetted dentin surfaces through water contact angle measurements. Microtensile bond strength test (TBS) was performed with experimental adhesives containing 6% HEMA (H6) and 18% HEMA (H18) and a commercial dental adhesive. Data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and post-hoc tests (α = 0.05). Results The enzymatic removal of PGs was confirmed by the absence and fragmentation of GAGs. There was statistically significant difference between the swelling ratio of Try-treated and control dentin (p < 0.001). Significantly lower contact angle was found for Try-treated on wet and dry dentin (p < 0.002). The contact angle on re-wet dentin was not recovered in Try-treated group (p = 0.9). Removal of PGs significantly improved the TBS of H6 (109% higher, p < 0.001) and H18 (29% higher, p = 0.002) when compared to control. The TBS of commercial adhesive was not affected by trypsin treatment (p = 0.9).

This feedback typically constitutes detailed numerical data regarding energy generation, consumption and price, and is communicated via energy monitors, apps, and other smart devices. Yet for a number of reasons both the concept of energy feedback and its implementation are rather problematic. Most significantly, interventions commonly depend on the ability of laypeople to interpret often complex and unfamiliar numerical information, as well as use, and regularly engage with, the various devices which communicate the feedback data. Moreover, by emphasising the perceived importance of data expressed in units like kilowatts and kilowatt hours, conventional feedback interventions inadvertently serve to displace the intuitive ways in which householders already engage with, and understand, energy. While the impetus to communicate energy feedback remains, there is nonetheless an evident need to do so in a more accessible manner.

We conclude with a user study in which the effectiveness of the plug's novel interactive capabilities is assessed (mid-air, hand-based motion matching).

When teaching graduate classes with this book, whether in a quarter- or semester-long course, we recommend initially requiring that students spend two weeks reading the introductory textbook, The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces (Morgan & Claypool Publishers, Human-Centered Interfaces Synthesis Series, 2015). With this orientation, a graduate class providing an overview of multimodal-multisensor interfaces then could select chapters from the current handbook, distributed across topics in the different sections.As an example, in a 10-week course the remaining 8 weeks might be allocated to reading select chapters on: (1) theory, user modeling, and common modality combinations (2 weeks); (2) prototyping and software tools, signal processing, and architectures (2 weeks); (3) language and dialogue processing (1 week); (4) detection of emotional and cognitive state (2 weeks); and (5) commercialization, future trends, and societal issues (1 week). In a more extended 16-week course, we recommend spending an additional week reading and discussing chapters on each of these five topic areas, as well as an additional week on the introductory textbook, The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces. As an alternative, in a semester-long course in which students will be conducting a project in one target area (e.g., designing multimodal dialogue systems for in-vehicle use), some or all of the additional time in the semester course could be spent: (1) reading a more in-depth collection of handbook chapters on language and dialogue processing (e.g., 2 weeks) and (2) conducting the hands-on project (e.g., 4 weeks).For more tailored versions of a course on multimodal-multisensor interfaces, another approach is to have students read the handbook chapters in relevant sections and then follow up with more targeted and in-depth technical papers. For example, a course intended for a cognitive science audience might start by reading The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces, followed by assigning chapters from the handbook sections on: (1) theory, user modeling, and common modality combinations; (2) multimodal processing of social and emotional information; and (3) multimodal processing of cognition and mental health status. Afterward, the course could teach students different computational and statistical analysis techniques related to these chapters, ideally through demonstration. Students might then be asked to conduct a hands-on project in which they apply one or more analysis methods to multimodal data to build user models or predict mental states.As a second example, a course intended for a computer science audience might also start by reading The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces, followed by assigning chapters on: (1) prototyping and software tools; (2) multimodal signal processing and architectures; and (3) language and dialogue processing. Afterward, students might engage in a hands-on project in which they design, build, and evaluate the performance of a multimodal system.In all of these teaching scenarios, we anticipate that professors will find this handbook to be a particularly comprehensive and valuable current resource for teaching about multimodal-multisensor interfaces.AcknowledgmentsIn the present age, reviewers are one of the most precious commodities on earth.

Besides, energy monitoring becomes one of the most important research topics nowadays as it enables us the possibility of understanding the consumption of the facilities. This, along with energy forecasting, represents a very decisive task for energy efficiency. The goal of this study is divided into two parts. First to provide a methodology to predict energy usage every hour. To do so, several Machine Learning technologies were analysed: Trees, Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks. Besides, as the University of Granada lacks a tool to properly monitoring those data, a second aim is to propose an intelligent system to visualize and to use those models in order to predict energy consumption in real-time. To this end, we designed VIMOEN (VIsual MOnitoring of ENergy), a web-based application to provide not only visual information about the energy consumption of a set of geographically-distributed buildings but also expected expenditures in the near future. The system has been designed to be easy-to-use and intuitive for non-expert users. Our system was validated on data coming from buildings of the UGR and the experiments show that the Elman Neural Networks proved to be the most accurate and stable model and since the 5th hour the results maintain accuracy.",2020-07,8/19/2020 7:00,8/19/2020 7:00,,101315,,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd,,C:\Users\Hafidz\Zotero\storage\PRUP5ZT6\Ruiz et al. - 2020 - A case study on understanding energy consumption through prediction and visualization (VIMOEN).pdf,,Visualization; Energy efficiency; Energy forecasting; Energy monitoring; Mapbox,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
